# 0005 — Saved profiles live in Firestore, and need an account

**Status:** accepted, 2026-08-07.

## Context

The app grew a saved-profile library: name the board, get it back later. The
first version kept it in `localStorage`, beside Scenes and the pinned-slider
list, because that is where every other durable thing in this app lives and it
needed no backend.

That store is the wrong shape for the one thing a saved profile promises. A
profile is worth naming because you want it _later_ — and "later" is usually a
different machine, a different browser, or after the day someone clears site
data. `localStorage` cannot promise any of those. It is per-origin, per-browser,
and it is the first thing a cleanup wipes. The library was the one feature in
the app whose value grew the longer it survived, stored in the one place that
guarantees it will not.

The replacement is Firebase Authentication (Google) plus Cloud Firestore,
project `ntscjs-d4f56`, one document per user at `users/{uid}`.

## Decision

**Firestore is the only store for profiles, and saving requires being signed
in.** There is no local copy and no offline queue: signed out, the save box is
replaced by a sign-in button, `ctrl+S` refuses out loud (the button goes amber
and reads `sign in`), and the ⌘K row says why.

The alternative — local-first with the cloud as a mirror — was considered and
declined. It is friendlier in the moment and it is what ytshuffle2 does, but it
buys that friendliness with a merge: the same name saved on two devices, a
profile deleted on one and still present on the other, edits made signed out
that have to survive a later sign-in. ytshuffle2 shows the failure mode — its
`adoptCloudData` assigns the cloud library over the local one, so anything saved
while signed out is lost at the next sign-in, silently. One store has one truth
and needs no reconciliation, and a library that quietly loses entries is worse
than one that says "sign in first".

**What this does not touch.** Everything else in the app works exactly as it
did, signed out, offline, forever: presets, the 1–9 scenes, pinned sliders, the
URL that carries the whole look, the ⧉ link beside each saved profile. An
account buys the library and nothing else, and no feature was moved behind it.

## Consequences

- **The Firebase SDK is loaded on demand, never at startup.** `firebase/app` +
  `auth` + `firestore/lite` is ~78kB gzipped across four chunks, and this is a
  WebGPU app that is judged on its first frame. `cloud.ts` imports all three
  dynamically, and the auth subscription is installed only when a `localStorage`
  hint says this browser has signed in before. Measured on a signed-out session
  that also pressed ctrl+S: **zero** requests to any Firebase or Google host.
- **The web config is committed, not injected.** A Firebase web config is a set
  of public identifiers — it ships in the bundle of every deployed Firebase app
  — so `firestore.rules` and the authorized-domains list are what actually
  protect the project. Committing it is also what lets the GitHub Pages workflow
  build with no secrets; ytshuffle2 reads its config from `VITE_` vars that its
  CI does not set, so the bundle it deploys carries `undefined` for all seven
  fields.
- **`firebase.json`'s `auth.authorizedDomains` does not work.** The Firebase
  skill documents the field, and `firebase-tools` 15.26.0 rejects it as an
  unknown property while reporting the rest of the deploy as a success — so the
  provider was enabled and the domain list silently was not. The CLI-created
  auth config contained only `ntscjs-d4f56.firebaseapp.com` and
  `ntscjs-d4f56.web.app`: **not** `localhost`, which is why the first sign-in
  attempt failed with `auth/unauthorized-domain`. The list is now set through
  the Identity Toolkit admin API (`localhost`, both firebase domains, and
  `cmdcolin.github.io` for Pages). Anyone adding a deploy target has to add its
  host there too, and the CLI will not do it for them.
- **The rules are tested, and the tests are mutation-checked.**
  `src/ui/firestoreRules.test.ts` runs `firestore.rules` against the real rules
  engine in the Firestore emulator (`pnpm test:rules`, and a CI arm); a bare
  `pnpm test` skips it, so the suite still runs on a machine with no Java. It
  covers owner read/write, a second signed-in uid, an unauthenticated client,
  the 200-entry cap on create **and** update, `hasOnly`, non-list `profiles`,
  other collections, and enumeration of `/users`. Each guard was then removed
  one at a time to confirm a test goes red — which is how one test was caught
  being useless: an _unconstrained_ collection query is refused whatever the
  rules say, because `request.auth.uid == uid` cannot hold across every document
  it matches, so it passed identically against `allow read`. Pinning the
  get/list split needs a query whose wildcard is bound
  (`where(documentId(), '==', uid)`). Anyone adding a rule here should mutate it
  and watch a test fail before believing the green.
- **The rules cannot validate the list's contents.** `profiles` is a list, and
  rules cannot iterate one, so they check the document's shape and cap its size
  (200 entries) while the client sanitizes each entry on read. One document
  _per_ profile would let rules check every field, and was declined because a
  collection has no order — and the list's insertion order is what makes it
  readable by eye mid-set.
- **A popup, not a redirect.** A redirect would take the tab away and return to
  a cold page, which in this app means tearing down a `GPUDevice` and building
  another one to sign in — see
  [0004](0004-never-destroy-a-presenting-device.md). Audited against the
  `firebase-security-rules-auditor` checklist, this is the one finding: no
  per-entry type or length check, so a signed-in user can bloat their **own**
  document up to Firestore's 1MiB ceiling. Self-data only, no path to anyone
  else's — a "minor" on that scale, and the price of keeping insertion order.
- **Deploying the rules is a manual step.** `pnpm firebase-deploy` sends them,
  and nothing in CI does. So an edit to `firestore.rules` can be committed, pass
  its tests, and never reach the project — the tests prove the file is right,
  not that it is live. Deploy after changing it. (Wiring it into CI needs a
  service-account secret in the repo, which is a bigger decision than this
  record.)
- **Firestore is a dependency of one feature, not of the app.** If the project
  goes away, saving stops and everything else keeps working.
