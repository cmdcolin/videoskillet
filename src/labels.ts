// The single-view half of the labelling tool: what a look *is*, and how cool it is.
//
// Pairwise comparison answers one question well — which of these two would you
// keep — and that is a single scalar. It cannot answer "give me something dreamy",
// which is closer to how a look actually gets reached for mid-set. So there is a
// second mode, and it records two different kinds of thing about one candidate:
// a set of tags, and a rating.
//
// **The rule that decides the vocabulary: never record what the recipe already
// knows.** A tag like "vhs" or "feedback" is worthless here, because the candidate
// record already carries `{vhs: 1, 'fb bloom': 0.4}` and any model can read the
// mechanism straight off the weights. What the parameter vector does *not* encode
// is how the result reads — and that is the only information a human is adding.
//
// So every tag below is perceptual or affective, and each cuts across mechanism:
// two completely unrelated recipes can both be calm and warm, and learning that
// mapping is the whole point.

// Bumped when the vocabulary changes. Stored on every record, because the dataset
// outlives the list: a row tagged under v1 was shown ten choices, and a training
// script reading a mixed export has to know that the absence of a v2 tag on it
// means "was never offered" rather than "was rejected".
//
// Which is also the honest warning about this list. Adding an eleventh tag does not
// retroactively label the views already collected under v1 — those rows are simply
// silent about it. Cheap to represent, not cheap to fix, so the vocabulary is worth
// getting right before a few hundred views go by.
export const TAG_SET_VERSION = 1

// Ten, on the number keys, in opposing pairs — but recorded as ten independent
// flags rather than five axes, because a look can genuinely be neither calm nor
// violent, and forcing a midpoint would invent data. A pair that is never both is
// a fact the fit can discover; one that is sometimes both is a fact a forced axis
