// The two records the vote page writes, and the sanitizers that read them back.

// Split into candidates and votes rather than one fat vote document, because
// that is the shape a Bradley-Terry fit wants: a set of *items* and a set of
// *comparisons* between them. A candidate is written once, keyed by what it
// means (recipeId), and accumulates however many comparisons it appears in. One
// combined document per vote would store the same look a dozen times and leave
// the training script to dedupe it.

// What a voter said about a pair. Four answers rather than two, and the two extra
// ones are not politeness:
//
//   'skip'    — I cannot judge this pair (didn't watch it, misrendered, bored).
//               Carries no preference and is dropped from the fit.
//   'neither' — both of these are bad. This *is* signal, and it is the signal
//               the current surprise button most needs: a comparison only ever
//               says one look beat another, so a pool of uniformly awful rolls
//               produces confident rankings among awful things. 'neither' is
//               what marks a region of the space as not worth searching.
//
// A 'both' option was considered and left out. "Both are great" is a preference
// of zero between them, which is what a skip already contributes to a pairwise
// fit, and the extra key was one more thing to decide per pair at the cost of
// slowing every vote down.

  // that only stored `{vhs: 1, 'fb bloom': 0.4}` would silently start meaning
  // something else the day someone edits that preset. And it makes a candidate

//
// A candidate's id is a hash of its recipe, and the document is immutable at

// same look rolled over bars and over a cartoon is the same *recipe* and hashes
// the same, so a `source` field on the candidate would mean two different
// stimuli fighting over one document, and whichever was written first would
// silently describe the other.
//
// The recipe is also the right thing to rank: it is what a later search
// optimizes over, and it is what the app can be handed to reproduce a look. So
// the source is a property of the *comparison*, not of the candidate, and it
// lives on the vote — where it belongs anyway, since it is a nuisance variable a
// fit may want to condition on rather than part of what is being scored.
//
// This is also why `candidateRecord` serializes at 'bars': the app's default
// source is the one mode `writeSessionParams` omits from the query, so the
// stored link is source-agnostic and opens on whatever the reader has.
