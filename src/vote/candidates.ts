// What the vote page shows a pair of, and what the training set is ultimately a
// ranking over: a *recipe* — a sparse weighting of the authored presets, which
// `blendPresets` expands into the full 215-control board.
//
// The reason the dataset is recipes and not control vectors is sample size. A
// human casts a few hundred votes, not a few hundred thousand, and no preference
// model fits 215 free dimensions from that. The preset weighting is the same
// search space `randomPresetMix` already samples for the "surprise" button —
// ~70 presets across a dozen groups, two or three of them active at a time —
// and it is small enough that a few hundred comparisons say something. The
// resolved controls come along in the record anyway (see votes.ts), so a later
// model is free to look at them; nothing here forecloses that.
//
// It IS a call into `randomPresetMix`, now that the function takes a `rand` the
// way `mutate()` always has. It could not be before: rolling `Math.random()`
// internally, its output could not be reproduced from anything written down, and
// a label is worthless if the thing labelled cannot be rendered again. Threading
// the generator settles that — the seed goes in, the recipe carries the seed,
// and the roll comes back byte-identical.
//
// Sharing the sampler is not tidiness, it is the premise. This dataset is only
// worth collecting if it ranks the space the button actually draws from; two
// copies of "the recipe shape" drift, and the day they do, the model is being
// taught to score rolls nobody can get. The roll's own rules — one lead whole,
// followers that do not tread on what it claimed, no second whole board — are
// therefore observed here for free rather than restated.

// source: every control in those presets addresses a second input that is not
// patched in, so they would render as near-nothing and lose every comparison for
