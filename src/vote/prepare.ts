// Putting a pair of candidates on the two engines, live.
//
// There used to be a recorder here: with one engine the two candidates could not
// be on screen at once, so each was rendered in turn and captured to a webm the
// page looped in a `<video>`. Two engines make that whole apparatus pointless —
// the canvases *are* the previews — and dropping it was not just simplification:
//
//   - The develop time stopped being dead waiting. A recorded clip could not be
//     shown until it existed, so every pair began with a stare at nothing; a live
//     canvas is watchable from the first frame, and watching a feedback look bloom
//     is part of judging it.
//   - No codec between the labeller and the pixels. VP9 on grain and dot crawl is
//     worst-case for a codec — every frame a fresh noise field — and if it mangled
//     one candidate's texture differently from the other's, the vote was partly
//     about the encoder.
//   - The pair is now simultaneous in the strongest sense: not the same number of
//     frames each, but literally the same frames, on the same clock.
//   - And the failure mode went away. A clip recorded in a throttled tab came back
//     with a handful of frames and had to be detected and discarded; a live canvas
//     in a throttled tab is just a slow canvas, on both sides equally.

// The names first, so a string off a <select> can be narrowed back to one with a
// `.find` rather than an assertion — same shape the URL reader uses for source
// modes.

//
// Wall-clock rather than a frame count, and that is a deliberate change from the
