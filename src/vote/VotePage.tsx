// The labelling tool: two looks, live, one question, a few hundred times.
//
// **Nothing on this page names what it is showing.** No preset names, no weights,
// no seeds, no "the left one is vhs". That is not tidiness — a labeller who can see
// that the left canvas is built on a preset they already like is not judging the
// canvas, and the model would learn that preference back out of the data as if it
// had come from the pictures. The recipe is in the record and nowhere on screen.
//
// The other half of the same rule is in the stylesheet: the two canvases are
// identical as boxes, because anything that makes one side prettier to look *at*
// becomes a bias the dataset carries.

// What each engine is actually presenting, as a health readout rather than a
// performance toy: a pair judged at 8 fps is a pair whose motion the labeller
// never really saw, and since two engines share one device it is worth being able
// to see whether they are keeping up with each other.
//
// Read from the engines' own stats rather than by counting rAF callbacks on
// the page, and the difference matters. The render loop has a fallback timer for
// exactly the case where a browser stops delivering rAF at full rate — an occluded
// or unfocused window — so a page-side rAF counter reads near zero while the engine
// is still stepping and the picture is still developing. It measures how often
// *this document* is painted, not how fast the signal path is running, and it
// reported 1 fps on a page whose canvases were visibly blooming.
//
// Taken from each engine's stats store rather than by hanging a handler on its
// `onStats` field: the store is the engine's own subscription, so a pair that
// goes away unsubscribes instead of leaving a field pointing at a dead setState,
// and neither engine's report can overwrite the other's rate on its way in.
