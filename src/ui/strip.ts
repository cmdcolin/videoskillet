// shape" of the design.
//
// `clip` is the ordinary one: the session string below says everything, so
// firing is a write. `roll` names a pool rather than a file and resolves it at
// fire time. `jitter` keeps whatever is up and shakes the look instead.
//
// Deliberately stored, not derived. `rowFill` below reads it off a session
// string, and a captured row records the answer so the tray can draw a card
// without parsing four hundred characters of query string per row per render.
// The two cannot drift because `rowFill` is the only thing that ever writes it.

// strip used as a bank of scenes with no timing at all. Otherwise it is "≈N
// bars", loosely: `drift` is a fraction of the hold, so 0.25 lands the boundary
// anywhere in ±a quarter of it, and 0 is the exact beat-lock the design keeps
// available per row for the cut that has to land on a hit.
//
// The default being loose is the taste call EDITOR.md names as one, and it is

  // time, and trimming it to three seconds puts it on screen for three
  // seconds. Here the two were always separate — the hold said how long you
  // looked at a row, the cue said which part of the clip played, and a
  // two-second clip under an eight-bar hold simply looped four times. That
  // separation is worth keeping (a piece cut to music wants bars), but it is

// The clip a row puts on deck A, when the session string cannot name it.

// and the reason the strip could not do the thing it was designed for. A row's
// session is `writeProfileParams`' output, and that writer drops every source
// mode a URL cannot carry — `file`, `library`, `browse`, `screen` — so a row
// captured with a clip on the deck recorded the look and nothing about the
// picture. `derivedLabel` called it "look only", accurately.
//
// **An identity, not a url**, for the reason `sources/pool.ts` gives about
// pool picks and `fileStash` gives about disk handles: a url is a rendering.
// A `blob:` dies with the page, an object URL dies with its revoke, and an
// archive's url 404s when a transcode ladder is rebuilt. What survives being
// written down is the shelf entry, so that is what a row keeps —
// `clipLibrary.openClipById` turns it back into bytes at fire time, through
// whichever of the three ways the shelf remembers it (a disk handle and its
// grant, a copy in the origin's file system, or a `PoolRef` to ask an archive
// for again).
//
// Beside `session` rather than inside it, which is the one place this parts
// company with _A row is a thing that already exists_. That section's rule is
// that new row state goes into `urlParams` — and it is right for everything
// that has: a `lib:c7` in a shared link is a promise about one person's disk,
// and the link contract's whole job is to be true on somebody else's machine.

  // and may touch a disk handle, so it cannot be done in `prerollFor`, which is
  // pure. The sink resolves; the walk only says which clip.
  //
  // Without it a rundown built the way the shelf's ＋ builds one prerolled
  // nothing at all: `prerollFor` read the session, `writeProfileParams` drops
  // the source modes a url cannot carry, and so every cut between two clips

//
// **The fault carries the whole step, not only the session**, and that is the
// correction this variant exists in its current shape for. Deferring the
// session alone and letting the rest of the row fire now inverts the order
// `fireEffects` is careful about, in three ways that all bite:
//
//   - a roll would land *before* the session naming its pool, and since
//     `applySession` re-rolls a `?src=…-random` itself, the engine's own
//     unseeded roll would then outrun the seeded one and win. A take stops
//     reproducing, which is the one rule adr/0006 says must not break.
//   - a jitter would be overwritten by the session it was supposed to be a
//     departure *from*.
//   - the lookahead would retire the very element the cut was about to promote.
//     There is one parked element per slot and `prerollUrl` clears it, so a
//     transition row prerolled the *next* row's clip over its own and every cut
//     paid the cold price — the price preroll exists to remove, on the rows it
//     was built for.
//
// So the rule is one sentence: **a transition row does at the cut exactly what
// a plain row does when it fires.** `atCut` is that step, verbatim.
//
// One level deep by construction, since `atCut` holds `PlainEffect`: a fault
// cannot carry a fault, which is the only nesting that would need a policy —
