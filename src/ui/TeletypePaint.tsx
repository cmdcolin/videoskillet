// Drawing on the card. Half of the SAA5050's character set was mosaic — the
// cell split into a 2x3 grid of blocks — for exactly this reason: a teletext
// page was drawn on as often as it was written on, and every weather map and
// football table on Ceefax was somebody pushing blocks around a 40x24 grid.
// This is that editor.
//
// It is not a separate picture format. Every stroke lands back in the card's
// own text as the mosaic character that carries the pattern, so a drawing is
// still a string: it goes through the same box, the same query string and the
// same clipboard as the words do, and it can be half words anyway.
//
// The surface is the card's rasteriser at 1:1 — dotGrid renders one dot per
// canvas pixel and CSS blows it up with nearest-neighbour — so what is under
// the cursor is what the picture will be, at the resolution the picture has,
// rather than a preview that agrees with it most of the time.

// The brushes, in the order they sit on the toolbar. The pen works at block
// resolution (a sixth of a cell); everything else fills the cell it is over,
// which is what makes a drag with one of them a fat stroke.
