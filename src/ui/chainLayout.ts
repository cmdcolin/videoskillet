// The chain map's arithmetic, with none of its markup (see ChainMap.tsx for the
// drawing). Its own module because every bug it has shipped has been in this
// arithmetic rather than in the elements: an empty chain divided the width by
// zero and wrote `NaN` into every attribute, which the browser drops; a
// one-stage chain divided it by one and drew a 280px bar where a miniature
// belongs. Neither is visible to a test that renders the component and counts
// elements — both are one assertion away from a function that returns numbers
// (chainMap.test.ts).
//
// **The app only ever asks for the whole trunk.** It used to hand over whatever
// a live filter had left standing, which is where the two bugs above came from;
// a query dims the boxes it did not reach now and removes none of them
// (panelChain), and `PHASES.map` is the only thing that builds the list. So
// every subset branch below — `fit` under 1, the gap clamps, the `at() < 0`
// fallbacks, the cursor that pushes one branch off another, the tape loop's
// choice of side — computes the same answer on every render today.
//
// It is kept general anyway, and that is a decision rather than an oversight:
// the arithmetic is a few lines, the subset tests are what pin the live row's
// proportions as well (a box is never stretched past its label on *any* row,
// including this one), and the shape that made those bugs possible is a design
// choice one commit could take back. What is not kept is a comment claiming the
// filter still does it — see each of them below for which case is live.

// answer you have to already suspect the question of. The whole map costs 18
// more units of sidebar — about 18 screen px at the panel's width — and it is
// the same 18 that let the third loop in, so the miniature stops disagreeing
// with the full diagram about how many there are.

// would have flipped that label onto the side with the TAPE box on it. The

// character at 8px, so 5.70 at 9px, and 'RECEIVER' is 45.6 of the 51.2 its box
// asks for — less breathing room than PAD promises and still not a squeeze.
//
// Measured in Firefox against .mapLabel's own rules (system-ui, .02em):
// the widest real label averages 5.07 units a character and a lone 'A' costs
// 5.28, so 5.4 buys slack on a platform whose system font is wider than this
// one's. It only has to be *proportionally* right in any case — `fit` below

//
// A flat average per character will not do here, where CHAR gets away with one.
// A box is *sized* from its estimate, so being 20% over on one name only buys
// that box padding; a run's label is sized by nothing and measured against a
// gap it has to fit in, so the same 20% is the difference between a label
// beside the head of the chain and the same label over the TAPE box. Measured
// in Firefox, the labels run 3.78 to 4.51 units a character, and the whole of
// that spread is one letter: 'm' is about twice the width of the average glyph
// and 'camera' is a sixth m.

// The three feedback returns, which are different loops around different parts

// stage sat on the trunk and all three re-entered *it*; the pass graph says
// otherwise (gpu/pipeline.ts), and the difference is the whole reason the three
// are worth telling apart:
//
//   camera — optical, and the only one that reaches back past the decoder: it
//     shoots the tube's face, so it taps after the Screen, and `compose` mixes
//     it in ahead of the encoder — which is inside Source A, before this signal
//     is a composite waveform at all.
//   mixer — electrical: `fbComposite` crossfades the bus against itself
//     straight after the A/B sum, so it re-enters at Mix, and it taps at the
//     Receiver because what goes round is the composite the decoder saw.
//   tape loop — mechanical, and the one that taps nowhere: `tapePlay` returns
//     onto the bus and `tapeRec` lays the sum back down at that same point, one
//     pass later. So it is a tight loop *across* the mixer's output rather than
//     a run around anything, which is why `self` is a field and not a special
//     case — the filter rules below are different for a return whose two ends
//     are one box. Named after its tape, and kept clear of the Tape box two
//     along by where its label is set rather than by what it is called — see
//     DELAY_LOOP_STAGE, and the choice of side below.
//
// Each is routed rather than swooped — up, back along its run, then straight
// down into the stage it feeds, so the wire is vertical where the arrowhead
// sits, which is the only way the three agree.
//
// The camera return is drawn dashed and the other two solid, the way a
// schematic separates a light path from a wire. That was once the *whole*
// difference between them here, which is why the map used to be the one place
// both were visible and still could not say which was which: a hover carried
// the names, and a hover is an answer you have to already suspect the question
// of. Each now carries its own name on its own run — the stage's own name off
// LOOP_STAGES, cut down to `short` on a run too narrow to hold it — and lights
// up while its own loop is actually running, so "which loop is on" is answered
// here rather than by opening a stage and reading three mixes.

  // How much clear width a label has where it wants to sit, and so which of the
  // places it is offered it takes.
  //
  // A run's verticals rise from the trunk to its own band, so they cross every
  // band below it and none above: what a label can collide with is the drops of
  // the runs *over* it, plus — for a return that reaches back across the map —
  // the corner where its own run turns down. Nothing else on the drawing is up
  // here; the boxes start 7 units under the lowest band.
  //
  // Only the tape loop is ever offered a choice, and it is the one that needs
  // one: its label hangs off the end of a 30-unit run rather than riding a
  // 200-unit one, and the side it hangs off decides whether 'tape loop' lands
  // over the gap at the head of the chain or over the TAPE box. On the full
  // trunk the left side is the 39 units between the mixer and the camera
  // return's drop, and the label takes 37.4 of them — so left is what it picks,
  // every render, with 1.6 units to spare. A shorter trunk moves that drop in
  // and it would go to the other side rather than write across it; nothing in
  // the app builds one, so in practice this picks left and stops.
  //
  // Worth knowing what those 1.6 units do and do not buy. `want` is the estimate
  // (RUN_CHAR), not the rendered text, so a platform whose system font runs wider
  // than the estimate does not trip this and move the label — it overflows into
  // the drop. The margin is against the *layout* being wrong, not the metrics.
  // Widening RUN_CHAR is what guards the metrics, and it costs this label its
  // left side the moment the estimate clears 39 units.
