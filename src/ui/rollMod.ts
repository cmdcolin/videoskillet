// Rolling the bay: a random patch of routings, as `mutate` is a random patch of
// values.
//
// The two rolls in the look bar moved where the board *rests* — `random look`
// stacks presets, `random nudge` jitters every control around where it sits —
// and neither could produce motion that nobody had written down. `random look`
// re-cables the bay, but only from the fourteen authored routings in
// presets.ts, so a session could go a long time without seeing an LFO on
// anything else. This is the third roll: it leaves every resting value exactly
// where it is and rolls *what is moving*.
//
// The whole difficulty is depth. The engine swings a target by
// `depth * (max - min)` (gpu/pipeline.ts › applyMod), a fraction of the raw
// slider span — and the spans are not comparable. The authored routings run
// 0.01 on `cfbDelayUs` and 0.5 on `bKeyHueDeg`, a fifty-fold spread, because
// what a control's span *means* differs per control. Roll one distribution over
// all of them and most slots come out either inert or a wreck, which is the
// failure that makes a random button not worth pressing twice. So the depth is
// derived per target, from what the slider definition already says about
// itself, and the hand-tuned answer wins wherever somebody has written one.

//
//   A control somebody has already written a routing for is proof rather than a
//   guess — six times.
//
//   A control that is off its resting value is in a circuit the current look is
//   using: the tape wow on a board with the tape path bypassed moves nothing at
//   all, and there are a great many such controls at any moment. Three times.
//   This is what makes the button answer the look on the board rather than
//   answering the app.
//
//   `fine` marks a trim — it adjusts the character of an effect some other
//   control turns on — so a wobble on one is a wobble on a detail of a detail.
//
//   `choices` is a mode select, and the engine does not snap a modulated value
//   to its steps: a routing on one slides between modes on thresholds, which is
//   a switch flipping rather than a fault breathing. Only at turbo, where the
//   wreck is the point.
//
//   A control the jitter never starts (`ROLL_NEVER_STARTS`) is off the list
//   while it rests at 0, at every amount: an LFO swings its target either side
//   of where it sits, so a slot cabled onto a stopped strobe starts one on its
//   first upswing — the same full-field flash the jitter is kept away from,
//   arriving on the button next to it.
//
//   A control behind a shut gate (`NEEDS`) is never picked, at any amount and
//   whatever else it has going for it. The 3× above says a control off its
//   resting value is probably in circuit, which is a guess; a gate is the app's
//   own statement that this control addresses nothing until another one opens
//   its path, and every row already refuses to claim a slot on one for
//   exactly this reason. Without it a roll spent slots on tape wow with the tape
//   path bypassed — patched, named on its row, and moving nothing — and spent
