// fields written out a second time, which is the same shape as the drift

// apart until they disagreed. Adding a field to a link is now one edit there,

  // bar says. The live URL is a mirror of the picture, so following the tween
  // is right there. A capture is a look being banked to come back to — a saved
  // profile, a strip row — and "a tween is a frame, not a look": bank the frame
  // and what comes back is a place on the way to somewhere, which nobody chose

  //
  // The dependency is the finished URL rather than a memoized closure over the
  // session's thirteen fields, and that is the better dep as well as the shorter
  // one: a string compares by value, so a render that rebuilds `controls` into
  // an identical board does not restart the debounce. Which also means no
  // hand-written `useCallback` — the React Compiler holds the identity of
  // everything above (see ARCHITECTURE.md › React Compiler is on).
