// "tags" — say what the look on screen is, and how much you like it.
//
// One button in the look bar, beside `saved`, and it belongs there for the same
// reason that one does: it is a thing you do *to the whole board*, in two seconds,
// and it should not cost a fold of permanent panel height. It sits next to saving
// because the two are the same moment from different angles — saving keeps a look
// for yourself, this describes it for the model.
//
// Why the app at all, rather than the labelling page at /vote/: that page is a
// cleaner experiment but only collects from someone who set out to label. This
// collects from anyone rolling looks, which is the whole difference between a few
// hundred rows and a few thousand. See useLookLabels for why the methodological
// objections to doing it here turn out not to bite.
//
// **The vocabulary is deliberately not about mechanism.** There is no `vhs` tag and
// there never should be: the record already stores the preset weights and the
// resolved board, so a model can read the mechanism off the parameters. What it
// cannot read is how the result *feels*, and that is the only thing a human is
// adding here.
