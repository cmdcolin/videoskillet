// Its own module because it is a list, not a component: a hundred and eighty
// lines of names and blurbs that App was carrying between its hooks and its
// markup, and every one of them is one call into something App already holds.
// What is left at the call site is which handler each row is wired to, which is
// the only part App is the authority on.
//
// Hold-to-compare is deliberately absent: it is a gesture, not a command.

// The cue verbs for one slot. Both are already on the row under that slot's seek
// bar and both have a key, and they are in the palette as well for the reason
// the Commons verbs in the same list are: that row lives inside a section which
// starts folded, and these are pressed while looking at the picture rather than
// at the panel.
//
// The name tracks the state, the way the star's does. A press means something
// different depending on what is marked, and a row that read "cue" while the
// next press would close a loop would be lying about what it does.
//
// One argument, and it is the slot: the tag, the duration, the cue and both
// verbs all come out of it together. Handed over as five loose values — which is
// what this took before ui/slotView.ts existed — it was possible to label B's
// row with A's tag, or to wire the tag and the cue to one slot and `run` to the
// other, and nothing but reading would have caught it.
