// The clip library: a shelf of the user's own footage that survives the reload,
// where "File…" only ever remembered the last one.
//
// The whole design follows from one fact about the browser. A `File` is a live
// reference to something on disk and costs nothing to hold, but it dies with the
// page — so a library is not a storage problem, it is a *re-opening* problem,
// and there are two answers depending on what the browser offers:
//
//   handles (Chromium) — a FileSystemFileHandle is structured-cloneable, so
//     IndexedDB remembers a clip by reference: no bytes copied, any size, edits
//     on disk show through. Read permission dies with the page and re-granting
//     needs a gesture, which is why a *folder* is the good shape here — one
//     grant covers every clip under it, where twenty loose files cost twenty
//     prompts. Clicking a clip is itself the gesture, so nothing needs unlocking
//     up front; the first click into a folder is the only one that asks.
//
//   names (Firefox, Safari — no disk picker) — nothing can be remembered by
//     reference, and copying the bytes is not an option a library can afford:
//     fileStash duplicates one file into OPFS and calls it cheap, but a shelf of
//     forty rips is forty duplicates against an evictable quota. So the *list*
//     persists and the bytes do not. A reload shows the whole shelf greyed, and
//     one re-pick of the same files (or the same folder, via webkitdirectory)
//     re-links every entry by name and puts them back. The list is the thing
//     worth keeping; the bytes are one click away.
//
// The shelf holds one other thing besides files on disk: rolls kept off
// Wikimedia Commons and archive.org. Those used to have a shelf of their own
// (ui/wikiFavorites.ts, deleted), and they do not need one — a remote entry is
// the *easy* case of everything above. There is no handle, no grant, no re-link
// and no reload problem, because the identity it stores is a Commons title or an
// archive.org identifier and resolving one is a request rather than a permission
// (sources/pool.ts says why an identity rather than a url). What made them look
// like a separate kind of thing was that the starred list was written first and
// for one of the two sources; what they actually are is a clip you keep, which
// is what this file is for.
//
// Everything above `── the store ──` is storage-agnostic list algebra, tested in
// clipLibrary.test.ts; below it is the part that talks to localStorage,
// IndexedDB and the pickers, in the same split savedProfiles.ts/cloud.ts uses.
