// entry points come to ~110kB gzipped, which is most of a WebGPU app's budget
// before the first frame — and the overwhelming majority of sessions never sign
// in at all. So the SDK is fetched on the first call that actually needs it: a
// press on "sign in", or a page load that already knows this browser was signed
// in (see SIGNED_IN_HINT). A session that never does either downloads none of it.

// Type-only imports above are free — they are erased before the bundler sees
// them, so naming Auth or User here costs nothing at runtime.

// identifiers, not credentials: it ships inside the bundle of every Firebase web
// app that has ever been deployed, and the apiKey only identifies the project to
// Google's endpoints. What stops a stranger writing to the database is
// firestore.rules, and what stops one using the project as their own auth backend
// is the authorized-domains list. This is the same call phyloguessr makes, and it
// is what lets the GitHub Pages workflow build with no secrets — ytshuffle2 reads
// the config from VITE_ vars its CI does not set, so the bundle it deploys
// carries `undefined` for all seven fields.
