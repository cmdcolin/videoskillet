// The deck: a second organization of controls the panel already has, by gesture
// instead of by mechanism.
//
// The stages below are grouped by where a fault happens in the signal path, and
// that is the right axis for almost everything — it is what makes the mechanisms
// interact for free, and what tells you which of three plausible places a
// horizontal displacement belongs in. It is the wrong axis for about twenty
// controls, and they are all the same twenty: the ones a hand moves *during* a
// take rather than dials in before one. A crossfade lives in Mix, the transport
// that shuttles a loop lives in Feedback, the tracking band lives in Tape, and
// performing with the three of them means three folds and eleven sliders.
//
// So this is not a skin. A chrome texture over the sidebar would buy nothing at
// 332px and cost legibility. What the hardware metaphor is actually for is the
// second index: the same controls, reachable by the gesture that moves them.
// Nothing here is exclusive to the deck — every control it touches still has its
// row in the stage that owns it, with the MIDI bind, the mod routing and the
// help text that row carries. The trims that are settings rather than gestures
// (a wipe's softness, its sweep rate, the slow-motion depth) are those very
// rows, rendered here.
//
// It was a `<Section>` of the sidebar, folded shut by default, sitting directly
// above the map. It is a box on that map now (DECK_STAGE) — the second of the
// two that are wired to nothing, beside the modulation bay, which is the same
// statement made about the same kind of thing: the bay is the hand you set
// running, this is the hand that is on it now, and neither is the rig. Which
// also settles what "folded by default" was for. It is not folded; it is not
// there until it is pressed, and it costs the resting panel nothing.
