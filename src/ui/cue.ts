// A cue point on a clip's own timeline, and the loop that can hang off it.
//
// This loop is upstream of the whole chain: a position in the source file,
// before anything has happened to the picture.
//
// The arrangement is the one a CDJ uses, and it is worth stating why rather than
// leaving it to be inferred from the state machine. The **in-point is the
// primary thing** — a cue you can drop and jump back to, which is useful on its
// own with no loop anywhere near it. A **loop is that same jump, fired
// automatically** when the playhead reaches an out-point. So one press marks the
// cue, a second marks the out-point and the loop engages, a third re-arms a new
// cue and the loop drops. One button, no mode to remember, and every state
// reachable from every other.
//
// Pure, and tested on its own: the gesture is the part where an off-by-one turns
// into "the loop button sometimes does nothing", which a browser is an expensive
// place to find out about.

// double-tap is how you ask for the shortest stutter the clip can do, and a
// gesture that silently did nothing would read as a broken button.
//
// It is a fixed duration and not a frame count, which is the honest limitation
// here — the element does not report its frame rate, so there is nothing to
// derive one from without sampling rVFC for a while first. 0.1s is three frames
// of 30fps footage and six of 60, but only one and a half of the 15fps Popeye
// clip on the shelf, where the shortest loop therefore shows one or two frames
// rather than three. That is a fair stutter rather than a fault, so it is left
// alone; what it must not become is a *hard* still, and it cannot — the wrap only
// re-seeks once the playhead has passed the end, so at least one frame is always

// **Deliberately not a verdict.** Two attempts at thresholding this were both
// wrong, and the second failure is the instructive one. Reproducible medians,
// `scripts/loopseek.mjs --file=` and the enc arms of `scripts/cuecheck.mjs`:
//
//   example-minnie-moocher   keyframe every 0.4s    12-15ms
//   example-popeye           every ~3.2s, 320x240   15-25ms
//   public/demo-v2.mp4       every ~0.45s           64-90ms
//   public/test.mp4          1 in 6s               137-165ms
//   example-haunted-house    4 in 21s              128-233ms
//
// The ordering is stable across runs; the absolute numbers move by about 2x with
// what else is running on the machine. Which means the gap between "fine" (~90ms)
// and "slow" (~150ms) is the same size as the noise, so any fixed threshold
// misclassifies one of them some of the time — a note that cries wolf on demo-v2,
// or stays silent on haunted-house, depending on the day.
//
// So the panel reports the number and makes no claim about it. That has a real
// advantage over a warning as well as being the honest option: the remedy is to
// mark the loop somewhere else, and a live number is something you can re-mark
// against and watch change. A threshold could only ever have said "bad".
//
// **A loop with a second read head does not seek, so it reports nothing** — and
// that turns out to be the threshold the two attempts above could not build.
// `ui/videoSlot.ts` parks a second element at the in-point and swaps to it,
// which costs no seek at all; where it cannot keep up it gives itself back, and
// the loop falls to seeking and starts reporting again. So the number now
// appears exactly when there is something wrong with looping this clip here, by
// mechanism rather than by a cutoff someone had to pick — nothing was calibrated
// to make that true, and the readout below did not change.
//
// What makes that hold for the whole life of a cue rather than only at the start
// of one is that a relayed wrap *clears* the window (gpu/videopump.ts ›
// `continueOn`). A head is armed unawaited, so on a big file a lap or two can
// wrap by seeking before it lands — and without the clear, those two laps would
// be the number this row showed for as long as the loop ran, while every wrap
// after them cost nothing.
//
// It also means what the number *measures* is unchanged and worth keeping: the
// silence a wrap costs is the seek within about 15ms (scripts/wrapsound.mjs), so
// this is milliseconds of dropped sound as much as it is dropped picture.
