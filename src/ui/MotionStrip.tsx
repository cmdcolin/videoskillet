// it better: a macro is only worth a knob once it drives several controls at
// once, which is exactly when it costs the most slots to set up — four clicks
// and a slot per control, out of eight. The motion amount needs no assignment
// at all. It is meaningful the moment anything is patched, it is the one
// gesture that scales a whole patch, and freeze holds every wave's phase rather
// than resetting it, so letting go picks the drift back up mid-stride instead
// of snapping everything to the top of its cycle.
//
// Shown only once something is routed: with an empty bay there is nothing for
// it to scale, and a permanent dead slider above the filter box would be the
// panel's most prominent control doing nothing.
