// How many lost devices in a row a session rebuilds through before it gives up.
//
// What this guards against is a *loop* — a device that dies, comes back, and
// dies again — because silently rebuilding through that hides the fault behind a
// picture that detonates every few seconds, and each rebuild costs the user
// everything VRAM was holding (phosphor trails, the frame store).
//
// It is deliberately **not** a lifetime budget, and that is the whole subtlety:
// a laptop that sleeps four times across a day-long session has suffered four
// one-off losses, each of which the rebuild genuinely handles, and telling that
// user the session is over on the fourth would be wrong. A rebuild that held for
// `windowMs` did its job, so the next loss starts a fresh count; only losses
// that keep arriving inside the window stack up toward giving in.
//
// Pulled out of useEngine's mount effect because it is the one piece of that
// closure that is pure policy — everything around it is refs, timers and React
// state, which is why the behaviour could previously only be exercised by
// driving a real browser at it (scripts/deviceloss.mjs).
