// One row of a popover menu. The icon sits in a fixed slot so glyphs and svgs
// share a text column; a blank hint means the action has no shortcut. `closes`
// is the menu's id: picking a row runs its action and dismisses the menu, and
// the browser does the dismissing, so there is no close callback to thread.
// Omitted, the row leaves the menu up — for a row that is stepped rather than
// picked, and wants the picture changing under a menu that stays put.
//
// It lives here rather than beside either menu that builds one: the styles it
// wears are this module's, and a second menu copying the markup to reach them
// is exactly how the two drift apart.

// Click-to-open menu anchored to its trigger, built on the native popover.
//
// There is no open state and no event listener here on purpose. `popover="auto"`
// gets light dismiss (click anywhere outside), Escape, and one-open-at-a-time
// from the browser, so the whole thing is a few attributes and a CSS rule
// rather than a useState, a useRef and a document-level pointerdown listener.
//
// The other half of the reason is the top layer: a popover renders there rather
// than in place, so no ancestor's `overflow` can clip it. This menu opens
// downward inside a stage that is only as tall as the picture, and used to lose
// its last items whenever the picture was short.
//
// The anchor is named per instance rather than left implicit: Firefox 151 does
// not resolve the implicit anchor `popovertarget` is meant to set up, and two
// menus sharing one name would both resolve to whichever trigger came last.
// React's useId is not a valid CSS ident (it wraps its counter in « »), hence
// the strip.
