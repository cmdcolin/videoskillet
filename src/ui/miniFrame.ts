// what each writes with the answer, which is the half that has to stay in the
// component.
//
// It matters that the four agree. A miniature is the second writer of controls
// that already have sliders, so the keyboard is the only way to reach the ones
// the frame hides — and a family where alt resizes on three pads and does
// nothing on the fourth is a family nobody learns.
