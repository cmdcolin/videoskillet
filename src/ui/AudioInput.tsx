// `.click()` the moment 'file' is picked, and this component unmounts whenever
// the Sound stage is folded, which would leave the ref null and the pick doing
// nothing. The app mounts it outside the panel (SourceSlot.tsx's
// HiddenFilePicker), where A's and B's already were.

// The clip on screen is one of the things it picks: a video's own sound track
// runs through the same analyser a mic or a music file does, so a tape can drive
// the set it is playing on. That used to be a "play audio out loud" button in
// Vaporwave — the routing was the same, but nothing could answer "is sound
// driving the picture" from one place.
