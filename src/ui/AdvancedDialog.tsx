          - **composite waveform** — the whole 910-sample line as brightness,
            blanking and burst included, squeezed into the picture width: sync
            tip black at the far left, then burst, then the active line.
            Everything the decoder is handed.
          - **luma channel** — Y after Y/C separation, black to white. Residual
            subcarrier here is what dot crawl is made of.
          - **chroma (U/V energy)** — the demodulated colour-difference axes as
            false colour: red is |U|, green is |V|. Grey areas carry no colour;
            which axis lights up says where the hue sits.
          - **burst / decoder state** — what the receiver measured rather than
            what it received: red is burst amplitude, green the phase error the
            hue correction is riding on, blue the chroma gain the ACC settled
            at. Bands mean the lock is chattering line to line.
          - **scope** — one line drawn the way the app's icon draws it: the
            whole line against an IRE graticule, sync tip and burst included,
            with the picture running dimmed above and a dashed cursor on the
            line being traced. Each column is filled between its lowest and
            highest sample, so flat luma is a thin line and anything carrying
            subcarrier is a block as tall as its swing, tinted the colour it
            carries, with its luma as the bright line through the middle.

          The same picker sits in the panel's View group, and \`?dbg=\` in the
          URL sets it at load. The ☰ menu has no tap row — its trigger only
          badges whichever tap is live, so a replaced picture always says so.`}

            still remember — turning it back on picks last session's clips up
            again.
          - **⏏ eject** under a deck is the other half: that one forgets, so the
            clip does not come back whichever way this is set.
