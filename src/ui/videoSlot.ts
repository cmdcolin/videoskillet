// One input slot's <video> elements: creating them with the playback settings
// the vaporwave path needs, pointing one at a source, and retiring it cleanly.
//
// A and B differ only in which engine setter and which React state a step
// drives, so those are fields on the slot and the mechanics below are written
// once. What is genuinely per-slot — the mode enum, the name label, B's enable
// flag — stays with the caller rather than being smuggled in here as options.
//
// **A slot holds two elements: the one on air and the next one.** That is
// preroll depth 1 (docs/EDITOR.md › _Performance: the boundary is the only
// cost_), and it is here rather than on deck B because B is the mix source and
// a take will want it. Steady-state playback does not care how long a rundown
// is — `VideoPump.due()` yields one decode per newly decoded source frame
// whatever is attached — so all of the cost is at the cut: a new element, the
// network, the first frame. A second element already loaded and parked at its
// in-point is that cost paid during the bar before it.
//
// **Depth 1, and the ceiling is structural rather than a rule to remember.**
// There is one `next` field, so a second preroll retires the first: each parked
// element is a live decoder, and an archive.org pick is a `blob:` holding the
// entire file (`sources/pool.ts` says why it downloads whole), so a deeper
// queue is a memory bug waiting to happen.
//
// **A running loop's second read head is a third element, and deliberately not
// the preroll one.** `docs/IDEAS.md` › _Clip cues_ filed the contention between
// them as a policy decision, and the policy is that there is no contention to
// settle, because the bound the preroll rule protects is *files* rather than
// elements. A preroll is speculative and names a different clip, so it can cost
// a whole second download; a loop's head is the same url as the element on air,
// which for a `blob:` is the same Blob and for anything else is a cache hit, so
// it costs a decoder and no bytes. Sharing one field would have made a rundown's
// lookahead and a marked loop take turns breaking each other, to protect a
// budget only one of them spends.

// **And it gives up rather than making things worse**, which the first cut of
// this did not and the measurement caught. A head only helps if the outgoing
// element can finish parking itself within one lap; where it cannot, the two
// elements are both seeking the same expensive file at once, and
// `scripts/wrapsound.mjs` measured that contention turning a 213ms dropout on
// every lap into a 1028ms one on half of them — the same silence, in worse
// lumps. So the re-park is held against the lap it had to fit in by a timer, and
// a head that overruns is dropped for the life of the cue — at the deadline
// rather than whenever it eventually finishes, because the wraps that land in
// between are the ones that would pay for it. See `promoteHead`.
