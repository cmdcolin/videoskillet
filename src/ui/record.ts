// Recording the canvas at a constant frame rate — the encoder half of
// docs/EDITOR.md › _Fixed-framerate export_, and the thing that separates a
// screen grab from an export an editor will conform.
//
// **What was wrong with what this replaces.** `MediaRecorder` over
// `captureStream()` timestamps by wall clock: a frame that took 40ms lands 40ms
// in, and the file records whatever the tab managed rather than what the
// simulation did. An NLE conforms that as variable-framerate and either drops
// or duplicates frames to fit a timeline — which is fatal for a piece cut to
// music, since the drift is not constant. Here every frame is handed over with
// `timestamp: i * 1e6 / fps` and the muxer writes one `stts` entry, so the file
// is constant by construction and indifferent to how long any frame took.
//
// **Firefox reads a WebGPU canvas here, which it will not do elsewhere.** The
// note in EDITOR.md — blank `toBlob`, no frames from `captureStream()` — is
// still true of those two APIs and is why the old path mirrored through a 2D
// canvas first. `new VideoFrame(canvas)` is a different path and works:
// measured on Nightly, a frame built straight off the WebGPU canvas comes back
// BGRA and full of picture. So the mirror is gone, and with it the extra copy
// per frame it cost.

// **The level.** A level caps the coded picture area, and Chrome enforces it at
// `configure` with a hard rejection — a 2560x1592 retina window codes as
// 2560x1600 = 4096000 samples against the old fixed `avc1.42002a`'s level 4.2
// budget of 2228224, and the recording never started. So the level comes from
// the frame, in macroblocks.
//
// **The profile.** Baseline was picked as "the profile every editor and phone
// decodes", which was an argument from 2010 and cost real picture. Measured on
// Chrome 141 / macOS against 16 frames of grain and one-pixel detail at
// 2560x1600, an I420 source encoded and decoded back:
//
//   baseline 5.0   175 Mbps   24.52 dB
//   main     5.0   143 Mbps   24.63 dB
//   high     5.0   143 Mbps   24.63 dB
//
// Same picture for 18% fewer bits — CABAC and the 8x8 transform, both of which
// baseline forbids and both of which are worth most on exactly this content.
// Nothing that has shipped this decade fails to decode High.
//
// Ordered best-first and probed rather than assumed: `isConfigSupported`
// discriminates here (it declines High 4:2:2 and High 10 on this machine), so a
// platform without High falls back rather than failing the take.
