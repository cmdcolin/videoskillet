// The profile library: who is signed in, what they have saved, and the verbs over

// **signed out there is nothing to save into**, and that shapes the whole hook.
// `user === null` is not a degraded mode with a local fallback behind it; it is
// the state where saving does not exist yet, and the menu says so rather than
// taking a save that would go nowhere.
//
// What that buys: a profile named on the laptop is on the phone, and clearing
// site data no longer loses the library. What it costs: no saving offline, and
// none at all without an account. Recall, presets and the URL are all
// untouched by it — a session that never signs in is the app exactly as it was.
//
// Nothing is fetched until it is needed. `wasSignedIn()` is a localStorage hint,
// so a browser that has never signed in subscribes to nothing and downloads none
// of the SDK, while one that has picks its session back up on load.

// One value rather than three flags, because the three states are exclusive and
// as separate booleans they could contradict each other on screen — a ✓ next to
// an amber `sign in` is a button claiming a save both did and did not happen.
//
// All three exist for the same reason: two of the three ways to save (ctrl+S and
// the ⌘K row) happen with the menu shut, so the button is the only surface that
// can answer. `failed` is the one that was missing, and it was the likeliest of
