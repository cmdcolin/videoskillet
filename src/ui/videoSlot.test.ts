// The half of `videoSlot.ts` that can be held still. `armHead` builds an element
// and waits on the decoder, so it belongs to `scripts/prerollcheck.mjs` and the
// browser; `promoteHead` and `dropHead` are the *ordering* — which element goes
// on air, what is muted before what, and when a head that cannot keep up is
// given back — and none of that needs a decoder to be wrong.
//
// It is worth having here rather than only in a harness for the reason
// `memory/verification-cost.md` records: the deadline below shipped because a
// listening run caught the first cut making the worst case worse, and a browser
// run is far too expensive to be the thing that guards it from here on.

// A <video> as far as these two functions are concerned. Same shape as
