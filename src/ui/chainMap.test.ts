// Every bug this map has shipped has been in its arithmetic rather than in its

// (the browser drops the element); a one-stage chain divided by one and drew a
// 280px bar where a miniature should be. Neither shows up in a test that renders
// the component and counts elements, so the arithmetic is tested on its own.
//
// The app hands over the whole trunk now and nothing else — a query dims the
// boxes it missed rather than removing them (panelChain) — so the subset rows
// swept below are shapes `chainLayout` still handles and the app no longer asks
// for. They are swept anyway for two reasons. The properties they assert are
// true of the full row too, and asserting them across every shape is what caught
// the crowding cases nobody would have picked by hand: the tightest label
// clearance on the map turned out to be on the full row, which is the opposite
// of where a hand-written row would have looked. And they are what would keep
// the arithmetic honest if the trunk were ever narrowed again.
