// Which source dialog is open, and which deck it was opened for.
//
// Six of the picker's entries do not change a source when you choose them —
// they ask a question first. "Clips…" opens the shelf, "Browse…" opens the
// media browser, "File…"'s siblings open one of two URL boxes, a text card or a
// browser permission. Backing out of any of them has to leave the deck exactly as it
// was, which is why none of them touches the engine until something is picked.
//
// This was five useStates and five setters, and the cost was not the five lines.
// It was that *closing* had become a thing each caller had to remember: the
// shelf closed itself from `loadClip`, the browser from the dialog's own
// onPlay, the YouTube box from app.tsx, and a kept roll played off the shelf
// went out through a path that closed nothing — so the shelf sat over the very
// picture it had just put up, with nothing in the code looking wrong. A rule
// spread over eight call sites in two files is a rule with a hole in it.
//
// One state closes the hole two ways:
//
//   Only one can be open. Six independent slots can represent "the shelf is
//     open for A and the browser is open for B", which is not a state this app
//     has — picking a source mode is what opens these, and a slot has one mode.
//
//   `dismiss` has one caller that matters: `beginLoad` in useEngine, which every
//     path that gives a slot a new source already goes through. So the question
//     goes away when it is answered, whoever answered it and however they got
//     there, and a new source path cannot forget because forgetting would mean
//     not calling the thing that also cancels its stale replies.

// The six picker entries that ask before they change anything. A list rather
// than a bare union, so the picker's own ladder can test membership instead of
// naming all six a second time — the same shape SOURCE_MODES has in
// sources/modes.ts, and for the same reason: one place to add the seventh.
