// The shelf: named transitions, as recipes over controls that already exist.
//
// The design is [`docs/EDITOR.md`](../../docs/EDITOR.md) › _Transitions_, and
// the premise is the whole project's: **you do not draw a wipe over the cut —
// you break something, cut while it is broken, and let it heal onto the new
// clip.** `signal/fault.ts` is the envelope that does the breaking; this is the
// list of what to break, which is the part with taste in it.
//
// **The domain decides what a transition reads as**, which is why the five
// below are five different things rather than one effect at five intensities.
// The three-way split is [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)'s —
// signal, sync, deflection — and the two tape entries come free because the
// deck's own damage is already a set of controls.
//
// No new uniforms, no new pass and no shader work: every value here is one a
// hand could dial, which is exactly what makes this cheap enough to be a table.
// What it costs instead is defaults — a fault big enough to hide a cut is a
// fault big enough to be unpleasant at the wrong duration — so the peaks below
// are chosen to be worth pressing rather than to show the range.

  // pushed the ✕ off the end of the card, where `overflow: hidden` made it
  // unclickable. Measured at 203px of feet in a 190px card, and the card's own
  // `.field` rule already states the rule that broke: a control must not resize
  // under the pointer that is clicking it.
  //
  // So the card falls back on the idiom it already has — `.kind` draws a row's
  // filling as one glyph with the words in the `title` — and this is that glyph.
  // One character each, so stepping the ring cannot move the chips beside it.

  // the right duration is a property of the mechanism rather than of the moment.
  // A raster takes about a second to collapse and reopen; three generations of
  // dub need longer than that to read as wear rather than as a glitch. One
  // thumbwheel over both would be a knob whose good setting changes with the
