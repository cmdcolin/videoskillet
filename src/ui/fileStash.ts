// Reopening the file a slot held last session. A picked File is only a handle on
// the user's disk while the page lives, so something has to be kept behind.
// Three ways, and which one a pick uses is decided by where it came from and by
// what the browser offers:
//
//   handle — Chromium's showOpenFilePicker hands back a FileSystemFileHandle,
//     which is structured-cloneable, so IndexedDB remembers the file *by
//     reference*: nothing is copied, whatever its size, and edits on disk show
//     up next time. Read permission does not survive the reload though, and
//     re-granting it needs a user gesture, so reopening costs one click.
//
//   copy — no disk picker (Firefox, Safari), so the hidden <input type="file">
//     stays and we copy the bytes into the origin private file system. That
//     reopens with no gesture and no prompt, but it duplicates the file, so an
//     oversized pick is skipped rather than charged against the origin's quota.
//
//   lib — the source came off the clip library, which already remembers how to
//     reopen it and by which grant. Nothing is stored here but the entry's id:
//     a second copy of a clip the shelf is holding would be the one duplication
//     the library exists to avoid. This one covers the shelf's kept rolls too,
//     and they are the easy case — nothing on disk, nothing to grant, so the
//     slot comes back on its own at load with no click anywhere.
//
// Which one a slot used is recorded alongside the name and mime type in
// localStorage, since none of the three backends remembers those on its own.

// the file dialog where the shelf belongs.
// `clip` is the shelf entry this came off, and '' for a one-off pick that never
// went on the shelf. It rides along because a strip row names clips by shelf id
// (`strip.RowClip`), and the deck that comes back at load has to be capturable
// as a row exactly like one loaded by hand — otherwise `+ row` records a clip
// on a fresh visit and silently does not after a reload, which is the shape of
// bug nobody reports because it looks like their own mistake.
