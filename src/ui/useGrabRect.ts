// A drag measured in a frame's own box, with the box frozen at the press.
//
// It exists to delete a mistake rather than to save typing. Every pad that reads
// absolute positions has to freeze its box, for the reason `uvInRect` records:
// anything in the panel that changes size under a control write moves the
// frame, and re-measuring on each pointermove measures it *after* it has moved
// out from under the pointer — a fault that only shows on the first touch,
// which is what makes it so easy to write and so hard to notice. Written out
// per pad, the correct version was a fourteen-line
// quartet that had to be got right again each time; here it is what you get by
// default, and a new pad cannot forget it.
//
// Not for the pads that work in *deltas* from the press (PipFrame,
// MagnifierFrame): those are already immune, because the number they read is a
// difference between two client positions and a frame that moves under the
// pointer moves both. Nor for a grip that measures against something other than
// itself — PurityFrame's sizes against its parent frame, since the grip travels
// out from under the pointer as the patch grows.
