  // can fold itself and hand the height back. Presets is the case, and the

  // 162px of the panel's most contested space, and a click on the map is the
  // one that says you have stopped choosing a look and started shaping one.
  // Folding on the pick instead would take the chips out from under a pointer
  // that is still browsing them, which is the same click at the wrong end.
  //
  // Compared during render rather than watched in an effect — the same shape
  // LookSection uses to re-sync its held list — so the fold lands in the render
  // that carries the new look rather than one paint later. Initialised from the
  // mount value, so a session that restores a look from a link is not folded on
  // arrival by a token that has not actually changed.
  //
  // Only ever folds. Reopening is a click, and a section reopened stays open
  // until the next such moment.
