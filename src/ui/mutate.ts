// `strobeHz` at 0 is a picture. A hair above it the beam-blanking gate is held
// on, and the flash length is absolute rather than a share of the cycle — 40ms
// at stock — so *every* rate a roll can reach leaves the tube dark for around
// 95% of the time (signal/strobe.ts, and the measurement in DEVELOPMENT.md's
// screening notes). That is not a variation on the look: it hides whatever else
// the roll did behind a full-field flash a few times a second, and a few times a
// second is the band where a photosensitive viewer pays for it. The rule the
// button needs is therefore narrow — a roll never *starts* a strobe. Rolled off
// a look that is already strobing it is a control like any other, which is why
// this is a set of keys and a test against rest rather than another VIEW_KEYS.
//
// All three rolls read it: the jitter below, the bay (`rollMod`, which will not
// patch modulation onto a control it may not start) and the preset roll
// (`rollControls`), which used to be the hole in it — random look picked the
// strobed tube on 3% of presses and started one anyway.
//
// `clipHz` is here on the same argument rather than by analogy. A paperclip on
// the video output stage is a full-field brightening a few times a second, and
// the two points either side of it take the picture out and put it back at the
// same rate — which is the strobe's shape arriving by a different mechanism, in
// the same band, and it would land on a roll that never asked for a hand on the

// the raster rather than as a scan going wrong, which is the one thing this rig
// is for. So it stays on the control for a hand to pick, and a roll off a look
// already rippling treats it as a control like any other; what a press will not
// do is hand it to you unasked.
//

// damping ratio 0.66 at 0.5, where a bright edge overshoots once and is settled
// within seven lines, against 0.32 at 0.9, where the wobble is still going half
// a cycle later and content kicks it again before it ever arrives. Every preset
// that used the tank was authored at 0.8 to 0.9, and stacked under a roll that
// is a picture sliding side to side rather than a supply under load.
//
// `hvSagUs` is the same argument about depth. The line is 63.5us and the tank

// width at full swing; a throw could reach 100.

// the black-screen mush a full randomize usually collapses to.
//
// Travel rather than value, which is the same thing on the linear majority and
// not remotely the same on a curved control. Phosphor persistence is the worst
// of them: the value is geometric in the trail it gives, so a 0.12 jitter off a
// look sitting at 0.9 — a tenth of a second of afterglow — hit the top of the
// dial and half a minute of smear on about one press in twelve, wiping out
// whatever else the roll had just done. On the track those are a third of the
// travel apart, and a nudge moves the hold by a ratio the way the slider does.

// of them per press — measured, off five rolled looks and off stock — against
// the 10 to 35 those looks had off rest in the first place. That is not a
// variation on a look, it is every fault in the rig switched faintly on at
// once, over whatever you had dialed in; the button read "nudge" and behaved
// like a fresh randomize with the old look showing through it. So a control
// that is already doing something is always jittered, and one resting at stock
// only wakes with this probability — half the amount, so the same modifier
// ladder that makes a roll go further also makes it wake more. A press off a
// 14-control look now moves about 27 controls: the look, plus a handful of new
