// Exported for the two flags that are plain strings rather than JSON — the MIDI
// opt-in and the signed-in hint — which read them outside a hook and so cannot
// go through `usePersistedFlag`. They used to touch the global directly, which
// is the one spelling of a read this module exists to stop: both run from an
// effect body, and a SecurityError there is thrown during commit, so a browser
// with storage switched off lost the whole tree rather than one flag.

// this reads the raw string instead of comparing against '1'.

// switch, written by a toggle in the Advanced dialog and read once at boot by
