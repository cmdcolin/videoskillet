// in is a column — every vertical control in it is height taken from the stages
// below. The gesture that matters here is the *continuous throw you can stop
// anywhere*, and that survives the rotation intact; the axis was the part of the
// metaphor that was only ever decoration.
//
// Measured against the track's box as it was when the throw began, not as it is
// each frame: the deck sits above two sections that can change width under a
// control write, and a box read live would move under the pointer.

// buttons beside it say it means — which is exactly the relationship bGain and
// wipePos have in mix_b, and exactly the relationship two sliders in two
// different folds of the panel cannot show. `barThrow` is where that lives; this
// is the hand on it.
//
// It does not spring back, and that is the part of the lever that had to
// survive: a fader you can let go of mid-throw is what makes a half-dissolve a
// place you can sit rather than a moment you pass through.
