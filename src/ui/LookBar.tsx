// The verbs that act on the whole look, in one row under the masthead.

// They used to sit at the foot of Presets, where they were the last 58px of the
// section that already took a quarter of the sidebar — and none of them is a
// preset. Compare previews the stock signal, the two random rolls move the
// board wherever it happens to be, undo walks the history: all of them apply
// just as much to a look built slider by slider as to one picked off a chip.
//
// Chrome, not controls, so they wear the quiet outline the masthead icons and
// the catalog handle wear rather than the filled look of the preset chips and
// the control rows. That is the distinction the row is drawing: these do things
// to the board, the buttons below it are the board.
//
// "copy link" used to be the widest of them, and it was a button for something
// the address bar was already doing: useUrlState mirrors the live look into the
// query string every time it changes, so the URL is always the link and copying
// it is the browser's own gesture. It survives in the ⌘K palette for anyone who
// wants one keystroke for it. Losing it is what lets the row carry the panel's
// ordinary type size and still hold all five verbs — including redo, which
// never fit before at either size.
