// It holds FileSystemHandles and nothing else. They go here rather than in
// localStorage for the reason that decides every storage question in this app:
// a handle is structured-cloneable and a string is not, so IndexedDB can
// remember a file *by reference* where JSON could only remember its name.
//
// One store for two callers — 'a'/'b' for the file each source slot last had
// (fileStash.ts), 'clip:'/'folder:' for the library (clipLibrary.ts). They are
// the same kind of thing kept for the same reason, and a second store would
// mean a version bump and a migration for nothing.
