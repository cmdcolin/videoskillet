// How many of the off-stock rows stand in the open before the rest go behind a
// count. Six is about where the section stops being a summary and starts being
// a second copy of the panel: "howlround loom" moves nineteen controls, and
// unfolded that is 400px of sidebar above the chain map — the reserve the last
// two passes went to the trouble of taking out.
const CAP = 6

// What the look on screen is actually made of: every control sitting off stock,
// in signal-path order, as live rows under the group each came from.
//
// This is the panel's answer to the question a session asks most and could not
// ask here at all. Picking a preset is one click; understanding it was five —
// the chain map colours the stages that carry an edit and counts them, but each
// count is a fold, and the controls behind it are scattered down six stages
// that only open one at a time. So "what does vhs actually do?" and "which knob
// is making that?" both ended in a hunt, and the panel's resting state was
// 414px of chrome with not one slider in it.
//
// The rows are the real ones, so this is not a readout: the thing that made the
// look is the thing you drag, and each row carries its own ↺ for putting one
// piece back without losing the rest. The group captions between them are the
// other half of it — "mix", "gain" and "zoom" mean nothing out of their module,
// and each is a way into that module on the map, so the section doubles as a
// contents page for the look.
//
// Folded by default, and present on a clean board, because this is the one
// section in the panel that grows on its own — every other one is the size it
// is until you open it. It sits above everything you work on, so a row arriving
// here used to push the control under your pointer 87px down the screen
// (measured: first edit, panel at the top). useScrollAnchor takes that back
// when the section is out of sight above the fold, but nothing can take it back
// while the section is on screen: the growth is above your row and there is
// nothing above it to scroll away, so either your row moves or the masthead
// does.
//
// So the section doesn't grow. Folded it is a header and a count, and the count
// going from 3 to 4 is not a layout change; the header is rendered at zero rows
// too, so the first edit isn't one either. Opening it is a click you made, and
// from then on it grows in view like anything you unfold.

  // where most of these defaults sit). The drag would stop early and the rows
  // below would jump up under the pointer.
  //
  // So the list only re-syncs when something writes the board wholesale — a
  // preset, a mutate, a saved look, a link — which shows up here as a key arriving
  // that the list didn't have. Putting rows back never grows the set, so a row
  // you reset stays where it is, at stock and quiet, still in reach if you want
  // it again. "clean" empties the set outright, and that does prune.
