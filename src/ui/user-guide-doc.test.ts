// docs/USER-GUIDE.md is the page that survived being wrong the longest, because
// nothing reads it. A fact-check against these modules found morph's ceiling
// quoted two settings short (8s, against a ring that ends at 30s), ctrl/cmd
// described as one roll's own modifier when `mutateAmountFor` shares it across
// every roll, a stab's length given as the default as though it were the range,
// and source A's list missing the `screen` mode it ships. Every one of those
// numbers lives in an exported constant, so neither typecheck nor any test
// noticed the doc and the code disagreeing.
//
// The sibling page, docs/EFFECTS.md, solved this by not being written at all —
// scripts/docgen.mjs emits it from the control table. This page cannot go
// the same way: it is an argued tour of how to *drive* the app, and prose that
// makes a point does not come out of a table. So the countable claims inside
// the prose are pinned instead, which is the same bargain
// gpu/optimizations-doc.test.ts strikes for its own page.
//
// Flattened first, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy: oxfmt reflows
// markdown to 80 columns, so every phrase matched below sits one stray word
// away from being split over a line break.
