// A minimal MP4 (ISOBMFF) writer for one H.264 track, at a constant frame rate.
//
// **Why this exists rather than a dependency.** The app had three runtime deps
// (react, react-dom, firebase) and this is not worth being the fourth: what an
// export of this needs is one video track, no audio, every sample the same
// duration, and a single chunk — which is the simplest shape the format has.
// The general-purpose muxers are general because they carry fragmented output,
// multiple tracks, B-frames and edit lists, none of which apply here.
//
// **Why MP4 and not WebM**, when the app has always written WebM. The point of
// this half of the editor is "an export an NLE will conform"
// (docs/EDITOR.md), and DaVinci Resolve does not import WebM at all while
// Premiere needs a plugin for it. H.264 in MP4 is the one thing every editor
// on the list opens. That the output format changes is the point, not a side
// effect.
//
// **What makes it constant-framerate** is `stts`: one entry saying "N samples,
// each `delta` long". There is no per-sample timing to drift, so an editor
// reads one frame rate off the header and conforms to it — which is exactly
// what `MediaRecorder` could not do, since it timestamps by wall clock and
// writes whatever the tab managed.
//
// Layout is `ftyp` / `mdat` / `moov`, samples in a single chunk. One chunk is
// what collapses `stsc` and `stco` to one entry each, and nothing here streams,
// so there is no reason to have more.

// on every frame, because it is parsing the SPS one byte off; a stricter
// demuxer is entitled to refuse the file outright, and an editor is exactly the
// stricter demuxer this is for.

// `record.ts` now asks for) and can never equal its own NAL header, so the two being identical is unambiguous.
