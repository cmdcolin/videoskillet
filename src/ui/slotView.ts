// Everything the panel knows about one input slot, gathered into one object.
//
// **Not `VideoSlot`** (videoSlot.ts), which points the other way: that is the
// handful of refs and setters the source-loading paths *write through* to put a
// picture on a slot. This is what comes back out — what a slot currently is, and
// the verbs a hand has for it. Nor is it `SourceSlot` (SourceSlot.tsx), which
// is the component that draws one of these.
//
// It exists to delete a whole class of mistake rather than to save typing. The
// engine used to hand these back as thirty flat fields ending in A or B, and the
// panel fanned them out into two identical component calls by hand:
//
//     <SourceSlot cue={props.cueB} wrapCost={props.wrapCostA} … />
//
// which typechecks perfectly, draws a plausible panel, and reports one deck's
// loop cost under the other deck's picture. There were twenty chances to write
// it in the fan-out and twenty more in the props list feeding it. Handed over as
// one object per slot, the pairing happens once, in one place, and every caller
// downstream is A/B-free: it takes *a slot* and cannot ask which.
//
// Generic over the mode union because that is where the two genuinely differ —
// only B can be 'none' — so A will not accept B's mode even though everything
// else about them is the same shape.

// Why there is no `makeSlotView(key, …)` helper here, and the two views are
// assembled as plain object literals in useEngine's return instead.
//
// A builder is the obvious move: `transport`, `cue` and `stall` are already kept
// as {a, b} records and the four verbs are already key-first functions, so a
// helper could project ten of the fields below out of the key and leave nothing
// to cross. It was written, both ways — as a local closure and as an exported
// function here — and **both cost `useEngine` its memoization entirely**:
//
//     React Compiler could not optimize 2:
//       src/ui/useEngine.ts  Cannot access refs during render   (x2)
//
// Measured by bisection with `pnpm compiler`, and the result is blunt: *any* call
// to a helper in that position fails, while the identical object written inline
// compiles. It is not the arguments — stripping the verbs, then every field of
// the payload, then the whole payload, leaves the failure exactly where it was;
// replacing the call with `({ … })` and changing nothing else clears it. The hook
// holds four refs, and a call it cannot see through is enough for the compiler to
// assume one is read during render.
//
// That is not a cost worth paying for it. useEngine builds `App`'s entire input
// surface, and an unmemoized hook there is the panel re-rendering ~200 control
// rows on writes that touched none of them — against a pairing mistake that is
// now confined to two adjacent literals in one file, under field names that carry
// no A or B of their own, where `speed: speedB` in the object built for A reads
// as the mistake it is.
//
// So: keep the two literals side by side, and re-check with `pnpm compiler` on a
// React Compiler upgrade — nothing else in the build reports this.
