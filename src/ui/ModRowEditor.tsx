// against it. That reads as "the wobble is broken" unless something says
// otherwise; the fix is to move the slider, so the note says which way.
//
// Which end can pin depends on which way the wave goes. A one-shot struck at
// the bottom of a range is not clipped at all — it only ever pushes up, so the
// bottom is exactly where it has the most room, and the note used to tell the
// one source you play to move away from the only rest that gives it a full
