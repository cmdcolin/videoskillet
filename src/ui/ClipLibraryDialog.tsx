// The shelf. Files you have opened before, kept as a list you can click through
// mid-set instead of going back out to the OS dialog every time — and, in their
// own groups at the foot of it, the rolls you kept off the two public archives.
//
// Those used to have a dialog of their own, which was this one with the folders
// taken out. They belong here: what a user is doing at either is picking from
// the clips they have chosen to keep, and where a clip's bytes happen to live is
// a fact about how the row opens rather than about what the list is for.
//
// It is a dialog and not a panel section for the reason the saved-look library
// is a popover: browsing is a thing you do for a few seconds with your eye on a
// list, and a permanent fold of the sidebar would cost that height on every
// session including the ones that never open it. Unlike that library this one
// starts *useful* on a second visit even signed out — the whole point is that
// nothing here needs an account.

// A clip's state, as one character at the head of its row. Deliberately quiet:
// on a browser that remembers handles every row is `ready` and a column of
