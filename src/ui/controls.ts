  // 1x; 'persistence' is logarithmic in what the phosphor keeps back, because
  // trail length is geometric in it and a linear track spends its whole lower
  // half on holds too short to see.
  //
  // 'zero' and 'unity' are the general ones, and most of a control's tuning is
  // deciding whether it wants one: they expand the travel around the stock
  // setting (0, or ×1) and coarsen away from it, so a pixel near stock is worth
  // one `step` and the far end of the span is still reachable. Take one on any
  // control where the whole mechanism lives in the first percent — a detune, a
  // loop's geometry, a bend — and leave it off where the span reads evenly (a
  // gain, a hue, a key level): the curve is not a general improvement, it is
  // travel taken from one end and given to the other. `step` is the fine end's
  // resolution once curved, so it is worth lowering at the same time.
  //

  // on tapeLoopMm, the dub-generation buffers) were left where they are — but
  // the value is beyond anything the hardware would have done. That is the
