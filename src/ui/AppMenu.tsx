// Everything the app can do that isn't a control, behind one ☰.

// It used to be two menus a few hundred pixels apart — a ⋮ in the masthead for
// the board of controls, a ☰ over the picture for the picture — and the
// division was real but nobody was holding it: three rows (pop out, advanced,
// help) were in both, and the answer to "where is fullscreen" versus "where is
// the wide bench" was a distinction about what a menu is *of* that you had to
// already know to use. One list is shorter to read than two are to choose
// between.
//
// It lives at the far top right of the app, which in the ordinary layout is the
// masthead's right end — the panel is the right-hand pane, so its corner is the
// window's. `variant` is the other place it can be: fullscreen and the popout
// both take the panel off this window's screen, and from there the masthead's
// copy is not reachable, so the stage keeps one over the picture. Same rows,
// same order, a pill instead of a chrome square — the only row that differs is
// the one about the bar it is sitting in.
//
// Three states have to read without opening anything, so they ride on the
// closed trigger: recording (which has to carry across a room), a magnifier
// left anywhere but 1×, which would otherwise be an unexplained crop of the
// picture, and a live signal tap, which replaces the picture outright — the
// strongest case of the three, since without a badge the way back is a dialog
// you have to already know about.
