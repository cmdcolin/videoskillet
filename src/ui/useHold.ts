// Two of the panel's surfaces are this and nothing else: the Modulation section's ❚❚,
// which holds every routing's depth, and the deck's, which holds the simulation
// clock. Both had their own copy of "remember, zero, restore", and both had the
// same two-line comment about why the remembered value is local state rather
// than something persisted — a freeze is a gesture inside a session, and
// reloading into a held board with no memory of why would read as a hang.
//
// The two stay separate instances on purpose, and that is the point of a hook
// rather than a shared button: they hold different things (a wave's phase keeps
// running under one, the frame stops dead under the other), so one widget owning
// two restore values is how the two start disagreeing about what is held.
//
// The value itself is the caller's — controls for one, the bay for the other —
// so all this owns is the memory of where it was.
