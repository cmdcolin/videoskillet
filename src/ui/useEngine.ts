  // every way of superseding it — a following preroll, a walk ending — runs

  //
  //   - a walk stopped in that window has already run `dropPrerollOn` and found

  //     holding a whole clip for the life of the page — which is the exact leak
  //     `dropPrerollOn` was added to prevent;
  //   - a hand firing another row asks for a different lookahead, and the older
  //     resolve landing second parks the clip that is no longer next. Depth
  //     stays 1 and the element is simply the wrong one, which is worse than
  //     none: the cut that follows finds a mismatch and loads cold anyway,
  //     having spent the bar loading something nobody wanted.
  //
  // Same shape as `useStrip`'s `epoch` over a pending cut, and for the same
  // reason: what goes out of date is the *decision*, and only a number taken
  // when it was made can say so.
  //
  // A ref rather than the plain `let` that `epoch` is, and the difference is
  // where the two live rather than a preference. `epoch` sits inside
  // `makeStripRunner`, a plain object outside React; this is a hook body, and a

  // clip is precisely the source a session cannot carry. So every cut between
  // two clips paid the cold price on exactly the rows preroll was built for,
  // and a transition between them had one live picture where it needs two.
  //
  // **Disk video only, and it declines the rest in silence.** A kept roll
  // resolves through an archive request that downloads whole
  // (`sources/pool.ts`), so prerolling one speculatively spends a file's worth
  // of network on a row that may never arrive — and the cut would ask for it
  // again, since `showRef` has its own path in and no url to agree on. A grant
  // that died with the last page load needs a gesture and a walk is a timer with
  // none. Both keep the cut they had, which is the contract every preroll here
  // already has.

  // invariant `clipOn`'s fast path rests on.** A preroll parks a `<video>`,
  // which cannot play a JPEG — but `prerollUrl` writes the parked record
  // *before* it awaits the metadata that will fail, so for as long as the load
  // takes there is an entry claiming to hold this clip. A cut landing in that
  // window promotes an element that will never show a picture, where the
  // ordinary path would have handed the file to `showImage`. So the parked
  // record can only ever be footage, and the fast path is free to promote what
  // it finds without asking what kind of file it came from.

    // having failed to load. Measured when 'across the room' was still in the
    // list (it wound the other way, to 0.42): two of six boot rolls came up as
    // a stamp-sized set in a dark room.
