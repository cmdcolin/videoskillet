// Search Wikimedia Commons and archive.org, and *look* before taking one.
//
// The two random sources beside this in the picker are gambles by design: they
// roll something out of a curated pool and the caption is the first you hear of
// what it was. That is the right gesture mid-set and the wrong one everywhere
// else, and until this dialog existed it was the only gesture there was — eleven
// dropdown entries, each a mood you could not look into, and on archive.org a
// commitment to a download of tens of megabytes before you could see the frame.
//
// Two things make the dialog possible rather than merely nicer, and both are
// measured facts about the APIs (sources/commons.ts, sources/archive.ts):
//
//   Ranked search works where random search does not. `sort=random` throws
//     relevance away, which is why the pools had to be hand-curated: a loose
//     query sampled uniformly returns a Greek vase and a teaspoon. Sorted by
//     relevance, an arbitrary phrase is finally worth offering, so the field
//     below is the capability the roll structurally cannot have.
//
//   A thumbnail costs nothing. Commons renders a poster frame for a clip as
//     readily as for a still, and archive.org has an image endpoint that is no
//     part of the download. Two dozen results cost one search either way.
//
// The curated pools did not go away; they are the preset buttons. A name like
// "Marble busts" now leads somewhere you can see, which is more than it could do
// as a line in a dropdown.

            for nothing.

            No `loading="lazy"` either, which is the obvious thing to want on a
            grid and is wrong inside a dialog. A lazy image is evaluated against
            the viewport when it is inserted, and on the first search these are
            inserted into a <dialog> that is on its way to the top layer — so
            Firefox decides they are not visible and does not look again until
            something scrolls. Measured: the first search after opening the
            browser rendered 24 empty boxes and stayed that way. Two dozen
            240px thumbnails is not the case lazy loading is for. */}
