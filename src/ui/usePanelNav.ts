// Nothing stored is a first session, and it rests on the map alone. A first run
// did open on the head of the chain, on the argument that source A's picker
// lives there and a diagram of a rig with no way to put a picture into it is a
// dead end — but the map's SOURCE A box is pressable with nothing patched in
// (see `stageTop` in app.tsx, which is what decides that), so the picker is one
// click from the resting state and does not need a panel unfolded over it to be
// reachable. A sidebar that opens itself is the more expensive default: every
// new session, and every browser without the key — a fresh profile, a private
// window, another port in dev — starts with a stage in the way.
//
// This is why the empty string, which used to mean "closed on purpose" as
// distinct from "never chosen", is now just another way of spelling closed: both
// answers are the same, and the pair exists only to keep reading what older
// sessions wrote.
//
// A stage that no longer exists is the case that still needs translating. Left
// alone it comes back as a name nothing renders and no box on the map opens — a
// session that returns to a panel showing nothing, with no way to tell that from
// having closed it.
//
// 'Feedback' is stored state from before the split: it was one stage over three
// loops, and it is now three. The camera loop is where it lands because it held
// the group 'Feedback' opened at first. The other three are the same three
// stages under the names they were filed as before they were called after their
// machines rather than after the fact that each is a loop (see LOOP_STAGES).
