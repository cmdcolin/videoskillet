// Saved profiles: the whole board under a name, the way a synth saves a voice —
// dial something in, name it, get it back later. Distinct from midi.ts's
// DeviceProfile, which describes a controller's CC layout and nothing else; the
// `Saved` prefix is there to keep the two apart at a glance.
//
// The stored form is a query string — the same one the address bar carries, from
// the same writer (writeProfileParams). That is deliberate, and it is the one
// decision here worth defending:
//
//   - It is already the app's serialization of a session, tested, and read back
//     by a parser that drops anything it no longer recognises. A profile that
//     outlives a renamed control loses that knob rather than failing to load —
//     the property that matters most for something meant to be kept.
//   - It makes a profile shareable for free: prefix the origin and it is a link,
//     so "send someone this look" needs no second format.
//
// The alternative — storing resolved controls, the way Scenes did — would need its
// own migration story for every field that is not a control (motion, the vapor
// speeds, which source), and would still have to grow a serializer the day
// somebody wanted to send one to a friend.
//
// This used to be half a story: nine numbered localStorage slots called Scenes
// held the same thing under a number, for a live set where recall has to be one
// keystroke. They held strictly less than a profile does — controls and motion,
// where the query below carries the source addresses too — so the only thing
// they really owned was the gesture. The 1–9 keys now recall the first nine
// profiles instead (see `profileAtSlot`) and Scenes are gone: one library,
// named, unbounded, shareable, and **kept in the signed-in user's Firestore
// document, not on this device** — a saved profile is meant to be there on the
// next machine, which a localStorage copy could never promise. Everything in
// this file is the storage-agnostic half — the list algebra and the name rules;
// cloud.ts is what reads and writes it.
