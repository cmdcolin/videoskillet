// CROSS_REPO_SYNC_FILE(undo-history)
// A bounded undo/redo walk over whole look snapshots.
//
// One step back was enough while every destructive action was deliberate — a
// preset, a saved-look recall. It stopped being enough once finding a look became a
// search: mutate, mutate, surprise, mutate, and the frame worth keeping is
// three steps behind the one on screen with no way back to it. So the walk is
// retraceable in both directions, which also makes a wild jitter safe to try —
// the cost of a bad roll is one keystroke, not the look you had.
//
// Pure and generic on purpose: hooks have no test tooling in this repo, and the
// interesting behaviour (dedupe, cap, when the redo tail dies) is exactly the
// part worth pinning down.

// Deep enough to cover a run of rolls, small enough that a Controls snapshot
// per entry stays free — ~130 numbers each.
