// nothing else: a motion roll would otherwise be a step the walk could not tell
// from no step at all, so pressing it twice would leave only the first roll
// reachable.
// Whether two gates are dialed the same way. Sibling of `sameBay`, asked by the
// same walk and for the same reason — the reset is a gesture that stops the
// gate, so a walk that could not tell two gates apart would step back onto a
// board with the stab silently gone.
//
// `to` by reference, which is exact here rather than lax: the held board is a
// snapshot taken once by `holdLook` and never edited, so two gates share one
// only by being the same hold. Comparing all ~230 values instead would answer
// the same question at every entry in the walk.
