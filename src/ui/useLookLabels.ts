// Labelling looks from inside the instrument, rather than on a page built for it.
//
// The separate page is the cleaner experiment — blind, pinned source, pinned
// raster — but it only ever collects from someone who decided to go and label,
// which is one person on a good evening. The app is where looks are already being
// made and looked at, so the label costs a click at a moment somebody is already
// having an opinion. Volume wins, and the two objections that made the clean page
// look necessary both dissolve:
//
//   - "Not blind." The model's target is this user's taste, and knowing a look is
//     built on vhs is part of that taste rather than noise contaminating it.
//   - "Not a random sample." True of browsing, false of rolling: `surprise` draws
//     from the same distribution the labelling page samples, so a run of
//     surprise-rate-surprise is an unbiased sample sitting inside a biased
//     collection — and `provenance` on every row is what lets it be sliced back
//     out afterwards.
//
// What does not dissolve is that a rating has to be *cheaper than moving on*. If
// scoring a bad roll costs more than rolling again, nobody scores the bad ones and
// the dataset is all positives, which is the one shape a preference model cannot
// be fitted from. Hence one click to commit, and no confirm step.
//
// **Rating requires being signed in**, and the local store is an outbox rather than
// a collection point. The first version let a signed-out session rate freely and
// flushed the backlog when somebody eventually signed in, on the reasoning that a
// first session should not be wasted. That was wrong twice over. A rating that is
// never uploaded is worth exactly zero, so the button counted up to "tags 12"
// while nothing was being collected — and the backlog was filed under whichever
// account signed in next, which quietly misattributes labels when a browser is
// shared or an account is switched. Pressing a rating button is the moment someone
// has shown they want to contribute, which is the best moment to ask, not the
// worst. So the queue now only ever holds rows an author has already been
// identified for, and exists to survive a failed write rather than a missing
// account.
