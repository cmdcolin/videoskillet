// plus who it belongs to.
//
// It moved here from a slot in the LookBar row, among compare/mutate/undo,
// because those are verbs that act on the look that's on screen right now and
// this isn't one — it's a fact about the session, the same kind of fact the ⋮
// answers for the app as a whole. Buried a verb-width away from "mutate" it
// also read as one more thing to press to change the picture, when its whole
// job signed-out is the opposite: say there is an account to sign into at all.
//
// Signing in lives *here* rather than folded into the ⋮ menu's list, because
// this is the only thing in the app an account is for. A row in that menu would
// be an account prompt with no visible purpose; in this popover it is the
// answer to the question the popover just raised — where would a save go?
//
// The button says `saved` rather than naming the noun. "Looks" was the first
// label and it read as a verb ("looks 3" — looks three what?); `saved` is what
// the press does and what the list holds, and it leaves "the look" meaning the
// live board everywhere else in the app.
//
// It is a popover rather than a section of the panel because saving is a thing
// you do for two seconds and recall is a list you open — neither wants a fold of
// permanent panel height. Presets sit further down as chips because they are the
// app's own catalog, browsed by eye; this list is yours and starts empty, so a
// section for it would open onto nothing on every first session.
