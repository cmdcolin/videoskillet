// How wide the readout column is, in characters, for every row in one rack.
//
// A row sizes its own reading off `readingChars` — its widest *possible*
// reading rather than its current one — so nothing about the row moves while
// its value does. That is not a nicety: the readout is a grid column, its two
// neighbours are fr-based, and the third column is `auto`. So a reading that
// grew mid-drag (the ↺ appearing the moment the value left stock, then a digit
// arriving) re-solved the row and slid the track out from under the pointer —
// pressing at the middle of a 0–150 control and moving 4px right used to land
// on 110, because the track had shifted 16px left while the pointer stood
// still.
//
// This fixes the other half: every row in a rack reserves the same width, so a
// group's tracks start and end at one x and a stack of faders can be read down
// the column. Without it the widths are per-row (a "3.00IRE" against a "0.80")
// and one open stage came out with its tracks at four different x.
//
// A context rather than a prop because the rows are not always the provider's
// own children — LookSection wraps each in a <div> of its own — and threading a
// number through every such wrapper is how the two halves drift apart. Zero
// means "no rack": the row falls back to its own width, which is still stable.

          and until this it was the one modulation verb with no button at all:
          `remove` throws the routing away, and dragging depth to zero throws away
          the depth. Changing *what* is driving the control is set-up by
          comparison, so it moved to the ⋮ beside this, which is where the row
          keeps its wiring.

          A word rather than a ∿, and that is what stopped it being pressed by
          mistake: the strip's filter count wore the same glyph, so one mark said
          "this control is driven" in one place and "show me only driven rows" in
          another, and a session that meant the first got the second. Both say
          what they are now. `mod` and not `modulated` because this box is in the

          mode switch whose options are words ("alternate", "ssavi") and cannot
          be squeezed into a third of a sidebar. A switch that *does* fit there
          takes the one-line form, sitting in the track column where a fader
          would: `off|on` costs 59px against the column's 88px floor, and a row
          that can be one line has no business being two.

          The readout gets a column of its own rather than riding the label's
          line, which is what a first attempt did: at a third of the panel each
          the two of them together overflowed on any label carrying a
          parenthetical, and a fifth of the controls carry one — the label broke
          mid-phrase and the ? and ↺ scattered onto a line of their own. Split
          out, only the label wraps, and it wraps where a label should.

          The reading is written before the track and placed after it, by grid
          area (Slider.module.css). Same source order as the stacked branch
          above, and it is the order the narrow panel actually draws — where the
          row is two lines, the reading rides the label and the track is the one
          below. So the docked sidebar, which is where most of these rows are
          read, has its focus order and its layout agreeing; the wide form
          disagrees about two adjacent things on one line, which is the cheaper
          half of the trade. */}
