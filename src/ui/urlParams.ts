// `teletype` does appear — the mode is the source, and ?text= alongside it
// carries what is on the card.
//
// `screen` is left out for a different reason than `file` is: a share is not a
// thing a link can name at all. The grant dies with the page, the picker needs
// a gesture the loader does not have, and which window was shared is the
// browser's business, not the app's. Webcam still round-trips — ?src=webcam
// names a device class, and its dialog supplies the gesture on the far end.
//
// `library` is out on the same grounds as `file`, one step further along: the
// shelf is this browser's, so an id from it would name nothing in the reader's
// — and a link that opened someone else's app on *their* clip 14 would be worse
// than one that opened on bars. What the slot was on is remembered locally
// instead (fileStash's `lib` kind), which is where that fact belongs.
//
// `browse` is out for a third reason: it is a dialog with a search field, and
// what it was showing is neither a source nor a thing a link can put back. What
// came *out* of it is a public file that would load for anyone, but a link that
// reopened someone else's app on an empty search box would be worse than one
// that opened on bars. The two random archives do round-trip —
