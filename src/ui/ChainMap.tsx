// returns looping back over the top and the two branches — input B and the
// sound — joining from below, each at the stage it actually feeds. Clicking a
// box opens that stage's controls, so this is the sidebar's navigation rather
// than an illustration of it — and it has to look like navigation, which is why
// a box is a filled chip on the wire rather than another hairline rectangle in
// the same colour as the wire (see ChainMap.module.css).
//
// A return is navigation of the same kind, and it is the *only* way into one of
// the three loops: none of them is a stage of the trunk, so none of them has a
// box. A run carries its name, wears the same three states a box does, and
// opens its own stage — where a single FEEDBACK box used to open all five of
// three machines' groups at once, and the loop you could see running was not
// the loop a click reached.
//
// State reads as colour on one element: idle until you point at it, amber for a
// stage carrying an edit, accent for the stage that is open.
//
// Every coordinate comes from chainLayout.ts — the sizes and the arithmetic are
// there, and this file is the drawing.

  // source branch with nothing patched in is drawn inert and still opens,
  // because the picker that ends the off state is the first thing inside it —
  // it is the whole reason you would press SOURCE B. Mix is the one that is
  // both: there is no picker for "a second signal", only B's, so its box is a
  // statement about the chain rather than a door.
