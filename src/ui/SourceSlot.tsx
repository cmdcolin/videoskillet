// its subtree, which would leave the ref null and the choice silently doing
// nothing. That was already the arrangement while the pickers lived in a

// that shape what it brings in. It used to sit in a section called "Input", 60px

// surfaces for the same three things, where the box carrying the name opened the

// the engine genuinely does not own: the option list for this slot's mode union,
