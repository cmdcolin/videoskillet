Where the head read nothing the compensator patches the gap from a delay line holding the line above, and a line of NTSC is 227.5 subcarrier cycles, so the patch arrives exactly half a cycle out of phase: invisible in brightness, and in the complementary hue. That is why a shedding tape on a cheap deck streaks in colours the scene never had rather than in white.
