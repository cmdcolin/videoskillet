// The open stage survives a reload through one string, and that string has to
// answer for three kinds of stored value.
//
// A first session rests on the map alone: nothing unfolds itself, because a
// sidebar that opens a stage on every browser that has never stored the key — a
// fresh profile, a private window, another port in dev — puts a panel in front
// of the map for no reason the session asked for. The map's SOURCE A box is
// pressable with nothing patched in, so the picker is still one click away.
//
// The empty string is what an older build wrote for "closed on purpose", back
// when that had to be told apart from "never chosen" so that closing the stage
// did not re-open it on the next load. Both now mean closed, and the empty
// string is kept readable rather than kept meaningful.
//
// The third is a stage name that no longer renders, which is remapped rather
// than left to open a panel showing nothing.
