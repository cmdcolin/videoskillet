// Intercarrier buzz, sound half. `audiostate.ts` is audio going *into* the
// analog chain; this is the return path — the picture arriving on the audio
// line, which is what a set does when the sound detector's limiter cannot keep
// video crosstalk off the 4.5 MHz beat. `gpu/shaders/buzz_tap.wgsl` measures it
// off the composite the receiver locked to, one pair of numbers per line, and
// everything below turns that into something a speaker can play.
//
// The point of tapping the real waveform rather than synthesising a buzz is
// that the faults arrive free and in the right relationship: a bright scene
// buzzes louder because peak white really does overmodulate, hum bars beat
// against the field rate, a head switch clicks on the line it damages, snow
// hisses. None of that is drawn.
//
// **The tap is ahead of the receiver, so it hears the signal domain and is deaf
// to the other two** — the three-domain distinction in `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
// arriving in the sound. A rolling picture does not slide the buzz in pitch,
// which is the tempting thing to assume: the roll is `timing[V_PHASE]`, written
// by `sync` and consumed by `decode`, both downstream of here. A real set is
// the same way round — the sound detector taps the signal, not the yoke — so a
// picture rolling over a steady buzz is correct and not a missed connection.
// What does move the buzz is anything that changes the *signal's* timing, which
// here means the rate fields are rendered at: `timeScale` lowers the pitch.
//
// **Nothing here may reach AudioState's analyser.** That analyser fills
// `audioBuf`, which FMs the sound carrier in `channel.wgsl` — the carrier this
// tap is measuring. Wire the output back into the input and video → audio →
// video is a closed loop with gain, which squeals. Speakers only.
