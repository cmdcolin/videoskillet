// Head-crossing precession: where the bar pattern has drifted to, for a head
// that is no longer following one track.
//
// Off play speed the head stops staying on a single recorded track. Each sweep
// crosses |speed - 1| of them and the RF nulls at every crossing, which is one
// bar standing still at a pause and four sweeping at five times play. It falls
// out of the arithmetic that a loop running backwards crosses two per sweep, so
// reverse is not clean either, and never was on a two-head machine.
//
// Here rather than inside its caller because two decks ran it once — the shuttle
// on the program path (Engine.advanceShuttle) and the delay loop's own transport
// — and the constants had been written twice, staying byte-identical by luck
// rather than by construction. The loop is gone and the program deck is the one
// caller left, so what keeps this a module is the other half of that argument:
// these constants have to agree with `shuttleNull` in gpu/prelude.ts, and they
// are pinned by a spec of their own here rather than buried in a frame step.
//
// The wrap is far out (1024, not 1) on purpose: `shuttleNull` takes `fract` of
// this, so any integer would do for the pattern, but the shader also seeds strip
// identities off it — wrapping at 1 would reroll every strip at once, once per
// crossing, where wrapping here buys one invisible reroll under the bar noise.
// The small constant term is the servo hunt: a transport never sits on an exact
// multiple of play speed, so the bars sweep rather than hold still.
