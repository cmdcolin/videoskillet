// `data` is one audio sample per line — a field is ~1/60 s over 525 lines, so

// horizontal displacement directly, the way a synth patched at the yoke does
// it. Honest, but a periodic sound draws a periodic shape: a sustained tone
// traces a clean sine down the raster and reads as a filter effect, not a fault.
//
// `level` and `hit` are envelopes for driving the *oscillators* instead —
// detuning vertical and horizontal hold so transients knock sync out and the
// picture lurches and tears back into lock. That path is far more interesting,
// because what you see is a system losing and regaining control rather than a
// waveform traced onto the picture. `hit` is an onset envelope, not a level, so
// it punches on each kick instead of riding the bassline.
