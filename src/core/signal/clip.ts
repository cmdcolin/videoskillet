// A paperclip held against a point inside the set.
//
// Fifth sibling of glide, modstate, stab and fault, and it is worth placing
// against the four it sits with (signal/fault.ts carries the other four):
//
//   modulation — a hand on one knob that comes off again, continuously.
//   a stab     — the whole board replaced by stock on a clock.
//   a fault    — a few controls driven away from rest and back, once, over a
//                span, with a frame in the middle marked as the one to cut on.
//   a clip     — a few controls *shorted* toward a destination for as long as a
//                piece of metal is touching them, several times a second, at a
//                point you choose. Repeating like a stab, travelling like a
//                fault, and timed like neither.
//
// The timing is the whole of it, and it is why this is not the stab gate with a
// different recipe. A stab is a clock; a hand scraping a wire is not. Contacts
// arrive at *roughly* a rate and never on it — exponentially distributed gaps,
// which is what a Poisson process gives and what a hand doing something
// deliberate but unrehearsed actually produces. Two bites land together, then a
// second and a half of nothing. A metronome reads as an effect; this reads as
// somebody's hand.
//
// The other half is that a contact is not a switch. Bare metal on a pin bounces
// and scrapes, which is `chatter` — and the set does not recover the instant the
// metal lifts, which is the asymmetric slew below. A bite lands in two or three
// frames and takes five or six to let go.
