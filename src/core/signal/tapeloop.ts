// The delay loop: one loop of tape threaded from the record head, round the path,
// back to the play head. Everything the CPU has to know about where that tape
// is — how far behind the play head is running right now, and when the splice
// next reaches it — lives here, so it is testable without a GPU.
//
// What separates this from a digital delay is that none of its numbers are set
// directly. The delay is a length of tape divided by the speed it is moving at,
// so wander in the capstan moves the delay *time*; and the loop having two ends
// joined means one point on it is a splice, which passes the head once per lap.
