// Non-genlocked source B: its line frequency, field rate, and subcarrier are
// all slightly off from A, so its picture slips horizontally, rolls
// vertically, and its chroma beats against the burst-locked decoder. The
// accumulators live here in f64 and are folded into per-frame uniforms.
//
// The pause decks are the two inputs' pause buttons. A paused deck is a broken
// timing source: the drum keeps re-reading one track while the capstan servo —
// the thing that held the timebase steady — has nothing to serve, so the
// timing wanders aperiodically; the parked tape creeps, walking the
// head-mistrack stripe; and the servo hunts vertically in whole-line hops.
// Each deck feeds its own feed pass (feedA, feedB), which scatters that
// source's waveform on its own raster — so B's mistrack stripe lives on B's
// rows and rolls with B's picture, the way damage on the tape must.
// B's drum additionally alternates two reads whose colour-under phase was
// never interleaved, so B's hue flickers at frame rate; that phase machinery
// stays B's own, baked into its carrier by encode_composite_b.
