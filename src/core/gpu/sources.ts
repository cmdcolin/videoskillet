// flags that let the shaders bypass them, and the capping and aspect handling
// needed to fill them. The chain downstream only ever sees two texture views
// plus a handful of scalars, so none of that reaches it.
//
// A and B are deliberately asymmetric, because the shaders want different
// things from them:
//
//   A keeps its own aspect ratio and its texture is resized to match, so
//     `compose` letterboxes it against the 4:3 raster using srcAspect.
//   B is always at raster size with a centered 4:3 cover-fit crop, so the mixer
//     shader needs no aspect handling at all and its bind groups can be built
//     once.
//
// That asymmetry is why only A can resize a texture mid-session, and therefore
// why only A needs the bind-group rebuild hook.
//
// Nothing here knows what a <video> is. Frames arrive already decoded, as
// bitmaps, from `VideoPump` — which is the half of the input path that has to
// stay on the main thread, and the reason the split exists.
