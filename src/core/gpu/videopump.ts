  // Bring a slot's playhead back to the top of its loop once it has run past the
  // end. Nothing else is needed to make the next frame arrive: `due` compares
  // currentTime against lastTime, and a seek moves currentTime, so the wrapped
  // position reads as a fresh frame on its own.
  //
  // The seek is issued on the frame the playhead crossed the out-point, so the
  // picture overshoots by one frame at most — measured at 21ms against a 42ms
  // delivery interval on Firefox Nightly (scripts/loopseek.mjs), which is inside
  // the cadence the clip already had. What the same harness found the cost
  // actually tracks is how far back the previous keyframe is: about 17ms plus a
  // third of a millisecond per frame the decoder has to walk forward, so a
  // normally-encoded clip wraps invisibly and one with no keyframes in it does
  // not.
  // Watch the playhead so a wrap's cost can be reported. Runs every frame, before
  // the wrap below, so the "last position the picture was actually at" is current
  // when a wrap is issued.
  //
  // The wrap's own write to currentTime is absorbed rather than counted: it moves
  // the property instantly while the picture stays on the pre-seek frame, so
  // treating it as movement would report every stall as zero — the same mistake
  // the first version of scripts/loopseek.mjs made from the outside.
  // Listen for the end of a seek on whatever element this slot now holds. One
  // listener for the life of the element rather than one per wrap: a wrap can fire
  // several times a second, and adding and removing a listener each time is churn
  // that also races its own removal.
  //
  // A `seeked` with no wrap outstanding is a seek somebody else asked for — the
  // scrub bar, a retrigger — and is ignored, because it is not what the note is
  // about. (A retrigger lands on the same in-point and costs the same, so counting
  // it would not be *wrong*; it is left out so the reading means one thing.)

  //     not a new clip, so clearing the region here would end every loop at its
  //     first wrap. This is why a promotion must not go back through
  //     `setVideoSource`.
  //   - **the health window goes**, which is the one place this departs from
  //     retarget's reasons rather than borrowing them. `wrapCostMs` is what the
  //     cue row shows, and what it has to mean is *what wrapping this loop is
  //     costing now* — so laps the loop has stopped paying for cannot be left in
  //     it. Carrying them would let a head that arrived late latch a number from
  //     the two or three seeking wraps that beat it there, and report that number
  //     for the life of the cue while every wrap after it was free.
  //
  //     Clearing rather than pushing a zero because `laps` is the count of
  //     *measured seeks* and the readout says nothing below two: a head that
  //     gives up refills the window within two laps and the number comes back.
  //     That is only stable because a head cannot alternate — one that misses its
  //     lap is retired at the deadline (ui/videoSlot.ts › `promoteHead`) rather
  //     than left to be not-ready at every other wrap.
  //
  // Everything else is retarget's, for retarget's reasons: the listener follows
  // the element, the generation is bumped so a decode from the outgoing head
  // cannot write here, and `lastTime` is cleared so the first frame of the new
  // one is asked for even though it sits at a position the old one already had.
