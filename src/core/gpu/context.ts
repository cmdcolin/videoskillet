// `?gpu=low-power` sends the session to the integrated chip. Two reasons to

//
//   - Battery. Firefox pins a GPU awake for as long as a device is open on it,
//     so a discrete card that would otherwise autosuspend after a few seconds
//     idle stays powered for the whole session. The integrated chip is on
//     regardless, because it drives the panel.
//
//     Held against a specific doubt and survived, which is why it is stated this
//     strongly. The doubt was that what pins the card is *submission* rather
//     than an open device — in which case a hidden tab, which submits nothing,
//     would let the card suspend underneath a live GPUDevice and hand back a
//     stale one on return. `scripts/gpusleep.mjs` reads
//     /sys/class/drm/card2/device/power/runtime_status while driving the tab in
//     and out of the foreground, and the card does not suspend: not across a
//     genuinely hidden tab (`visibilityState` sampled throughout, ~11 frames in
//     three minutes), and not on any of the returns. The control in the same run
//     is what makes it evidence rather than an absence — close the page, leaving
//     the browser up, and the card suspends within seconds of the device going.
//     So it is the device that holds it, and `?gpu=low-power` does not buy any
//     protection from a power cycle, because there is no power cycle to be had.
//   - Bisecting a fault. "Does it still do it on the other GPU" is the first
//     question worth asking about a driver-shaped bug, and it should not need
//     a rebuild to answer.
//
// Anything else, including a missing param, means the discrete card.

//
// Measured on Firefox Nightly / Linux (`scripts/devicetear.mjs`, three arms, one
// tab each):
//
//   - four devices created and destroyed without ever presenting: 90 rAF/1.5s
//     throughout. Four created and *held open*, presenting: the same. So neither
//     creating devices nor holding them is what costs anything.
//   - one document, {device + swapchain + present ~50 frames + destroy} x N: dead
//     on the second round, no reload involved. Presenting then tearing down is the
//     act that does it.
//   - the same page reloaded four times in one tab, differing only in whether a
//     `pagehide` handler destroys the device: with the destroy, dead from load 2
//     onward — including "a reload lands in the same hole". Without it, four loads

// Hand it to the successor engine where there is one (the stash below), and simply
// let go of it where there is not. The leak is real and it is the cheaper side of
// the trade — an abandoned device keeps its pipelines until the document goes,
// while a destroyed one can cost the tab every frame it had left.

// that says why. What got past that was the case the policy deliberately forgives:
// one-off losses spread across a long session, the shape a laptop makes when its
// discrete card suspends under a hidden tab. Those are rebuilds that worked, and
// ending the ninth of them argued the opposite of what 0004 measured — four
// devices created and held, presenting, cost a tab nothing. What repeated creation
// does still cost is a leak bounded by the document, which is the trade 0004

// *in this document* than a session needs is the weaker signal, and since the gate
