// The board has to come back exactly as it was, and the case that breaks it is
// not the obvious one.
//
// Two routings may drive the same control, and the second stacks on the first —
// it reads the value the first already wrote. Whether that round-trips depends on
// something the caller never has to think about: a save/modulate loop written in
// one pass records the *stacked* value as the second slot's resting one, and a
// forward restore (last write wins) then hands the board back one frame of
// modulation richer. At frame rate that compounds, so the control walks away from
// where it was left for as long as the pair stays patched, and nothing in the
// panel says why.
//
// `SavedBoard` restores backwards so the earliest value saved for a key wins,
// which makes both loop shapes correct. These cases are here because the
// one-pass version was written first and typechecked perfectly.
