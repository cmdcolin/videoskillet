// Liveness watchdog, fired from a setInterval (which keeps running even when
// requestAnimationFrame does not). It handles two independent failures:
//
//  - rAF stops being delivered while the tab is visible and focused. Firefox on
//    Linux does this across fullscreen transitions and window occlusion even
//    though visibilityState stays 'visible', and re-requesting rAF does not wake
//    it. So instead of relying on rAF, we drive the render loop from setTimeout
//    (FALLBACK_MS) until rAF resumes — the picture stays live either way. The
//    fallback waits on queue completion between frames: rAF was also the only
//    backpressure against the compositor, and a fixed-interval timer without it
//    submits into a queue nothing is draining. It is also *bounded*
//    (FALLBACK_BUDGET_MS). A short rAF gap — the kind a fullscreen exit leaves
//    behind — is worth bridging. A long one usually means the compositor has
//    stopped painting this surface entirely, and then every frame the fallback
//    renders is invisible by construction: it cannot reach a screen nothing is
//    compositing. Pumping on regardless only burns GPU and keeps a stuck
//    swapchain busy, which is how a recoverable stall becomes a dead tab. So the
//    fallback gives up and leaves the cheap watchdog to notice if rAF returns.
//  - The GPU itself wedges: submitted work never completes (Firefox/Linux can
//    silently lose the device without firing device.lost). We probe queue
//    completion raced against HANG_MS; HANG_STRIKES consecutive misses means the
//    loop is spinning on a dead device, so we surface it instead of freezing.

// Nightly, spinning the main thread for 6 s with *nothing submitted and the GPU
// idle* left the promise unresolved for 6001 ms. The timeout that scores the
// strike is on that same thread, so when it fires far past its due time that is

// the probe says nothing about the GPU. Score the strike only if the timer was

// How long submitted work may sit unconfirmed before the rAF path stops adding
// to the queue.
//
// rAF is not backpressure. It paces *submission* to the display, not to the
// device: if a frame costs more GPU time than a refresh interval, every callback
// adds more work than the GPU retires and the queue grows without bound. That is
// slow and quiet — at ~21 ms a frame against a 16.7 ms budget it accumulates
// only ~4 ms per frame — which is exactly why it reads as "it freezes after a
// while" rather than as a frame-rate problem. Measured: 120 frames submit in
// 27 ms of JS and take 1121 ms of GPU to drain.
//
// This is a *wait*, and the fact that it is not a frame count is the whole
// point. A count has to be sized against Firefox's completion latency, which is
// a 100 ms poll (bug 1870699) and therefore a floor no device beats: a probe
// armed now reports on work submitted now, but only ~100 ms later, so on a
// device finishing instantly the frames submitted during *two* poll periods are
// permanently unconfirmed. That is ~12 at 60 Hz and ~29 at 144 Hz, so no single
// count leaves a fast display alone while still catching anything at 60 Hz. The
// count this replaces (12) dropped 58% of a healthy 144 Hz session, 50% at
// 120 Hz, 20% at 75 Hz, and 16% at 60 Hz whenever the poll ran 20 ms slow — all
// of it announced as "the signal path is costing more than a refresh interval",
// which was never true.
//
// A wait has no such dependency. On a device that is keeping up the probe
// settles at the poll floor however many frames went into it, so the only thing
// that carries this past its threshold is the queue genuinely taking longer to
// drain. Five times the floor: clear of poll jitter, and far enough below the
