// Source B is a second, fully-formed NTSC signal. Two ways to combine it:
//
// - Dirty sum (default): B is NOT genlocked to A. Its line timing slips and
//   skews (line-frequency offset), its frame rolls (field-rate offset), and its
//   subcarrier is detuned off the sampling lattice. B arrives as a real
//   waveform on its own raster (encode_composite_b, optionally through its
//   feed), and this pass resamples it at the slipped position and sums it
//   (optionally ring-modulated) BEFORE the channel, sync separator, and burst
//   measurement — so fighting sync, rolling bars, tilted tears, and chroma
//   beat patterns all emerge downstream instead of being painted.
//
// - Clean dissolve (bGenlock): B is genlocked to the house reference and
//   re-encoded on A's carrier and raster, then combined as a CROSSFADE, not a
//   sum — a production switcher dissolve/wipe. bGain is the fader; the wipe
//   pattern shapes the fade spatially so B replaces A rather than adding to it.
//   B's detune/roll/skew and ring mod do not apply on this path.
