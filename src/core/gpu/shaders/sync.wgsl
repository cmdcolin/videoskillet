// Two lanes, in two waves. The horizontal flywheel and the deflection sag are
// both serial walks down the raster, and they are independent of each other:
// the sag reads what the oscillator settled on this frame and last frame's
// beam-limiter drive, neither of which the flywheel walk touches. A workgroup
// of 128 puts lane 0 and lane 64 in different waves, which the scheduler runs
// side by side — one lane walking both loops in turn is latency on a single
// lane, and this halves it whenever the sag is on. Both lanes read the
// carried state before the barrier, because lane 0 rewrites it on its way
// out and lane 64 must never see that. Same arithmetic in the same order, so
// the output is bit-identical.
