// The engine as the page sees it: the narrow surface five hooks actually depend
// on, rather than the 1400-line class behind it.
//
// There is one implementation, `Engine` (pipeline.ts), and TypeScript enforces
// the match through `implements`. There were briefly two — a worker-backed
// `WorkerEngine` presenting the same surface over messages — and this interface
// existed mostly to keep them from drifting. That work is deleted (see
// docs/adr/0003), so what remains is the other half of its job, which stands on
// its own: hooks that need three or four methods should say so, and should not
// have to name a class to do it.
//
// **Everything here is synchronous, deliberately.** React is: a slider write has
// to be readable in `getControls()` before the next render or the control snaps
// back under the user's finger, and `useSyncExternalStore` wants a snapshot it
// can read now rather than a promise. Anything added here has to honour that.
//
// What is deliberately *not* here:
//
//   - `step()`, `frameNo` bookkeeping beyond the read below, and direct access to
//     the pass graph. Those belong to the verification harnesses, which reach
//     through `window.vf` into the object graph itself (`vf.prePasses`,
//     `vf.sources`, `vf.audioState`). `window.vf` therefore stays typed as the
//     concrete `Engine`, which is the honest statement of the constraint rather
//     than a gap.
//   - `pushFrameA`/`pushFrameB`. Internal to how an engine gets fed, not
//     something the app does.
//   - `Engine.create`. Construction is the one place the app has to name the
//     implementation, and it does.
//   - **Recovering from a lost device.** `useEngine` stands a fresh `Engine` up
//     on the same canvas and moves the refs across; that is a property of how the
//     page owns the engine, not something the engine offers, so it stays off this
//     surface.
