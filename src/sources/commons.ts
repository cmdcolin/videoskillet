// Random media pulled live from Wikimedia Commons, as a source either slot can
// show. Unlike every other source here nothing ships with the app: a channel is
// a *search*, and picking one rolls a file out of it.
//
// Why channels rather than one "random Commons file": a genuinely random file
// from namespace 6 is not usable material. Sampling 40 of them returned scanned
// newspapers, PDF pages, church exteriors and — for about one in ten — an audio
// pronunciation clip with no image at all. Commons is an encyclopedia's
// warehouse, and the median file in it is documentation, not a picture.
//
// The pools below are the ones that survived being tested by hand. Each is
// tight enough that nearly every hit is on-vibe, which matters more than pool
// size for a reason worth stating: `srsort=random` samples uniformly from
// *everything the query matches*, so it discards relevance ranking entirely. A
// loose `neon OR sunset OR "palm tree"` matches 8,350 files on any one of those
// words appearing anywhere in the metadata, and sorted randomly it returns a
// Greek vase, a teaspoon, and a maize farm. Search terms that would be fine for
// a human reading ranked results are useless here. Narrow beats broad.
//
// `deepcat:` rather than `incategory:` because Commons categories are a deep
// tree and `incategory:` matches direct membership only — "1980s photographs"
// has 17 files directly in it and tens of thousands below it.
//
// The channels are not the only way in any more: ui/MediaBrowserDialog.tsx runs
// arbitrary queries through `browseCommons`, which is *ranked* rather than
// random and therefore does not have the problem the paragraph above describes.
// The pools stay because a channel is a one-click gesture mid-set and a dialog
// is not.
