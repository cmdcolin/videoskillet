// Drawn square-pixel at 4:3 rather than on the 754-sample raster the other
// patterns use. The raster's pixels are not square, so a card drawn straight
// onto it comes back horizontally squashed once compose maps it to 4:3. Bars
// and sweep want exactly that — they are edges and gratings, and the squash is
// what puts their frequencies at the MHz they claim — but letterforms have to
// keep their proportions, so the card carries its own aspect instead.

// The glyphs are not typeset, they are *dots*. A character generator of the
// period held its font in a ROM as a few bytes per character — 5x7 ink inside
// a taller cell — and painted those dots straight into the video, so the type
// had no curves, no antialiasing and no hinting: only square dots on a grid.
// Rendering the text with the browser's rasteriser and calling it done gets
// letterforms far too clean for the rest of this app, so the card is drawn at
// dot resolution, thresholded to one bit, and then blown up with the smoothing
// off. Everything crunchy about it — broken thin strokes, stairstepped

// Garble: the page as it comes off a signal the decoder is barely holding.
//
// A teletext page is not a picture, it is characters — sent in the vertical
// blanking a packet at a time, forty bytes to a row, seven bits and an odd
// parity bit to a byte. Nothing is retransmitted on request. A byte that
// arrives wrong is displayed wrong, and stays wrong until the magazine comes
// round to that row again and overwrites it, which is why a page off a weak
// aerial is never fuzzy the way a picture is: it is *misspelt*, and it holds
// each mistake for the better part of a second before healing a row at a time
// while the next row breaks.
//
// So a hit lands on the byte and not on the glyph, and the three things that
// can come of it are the three things you actually saw on a bad page:
//
//   - One bit flips, parity fails, and the decoder throws the character away
//     and leaves a hole. Most of a garble is holes, because a marginal feed
//     makes single-bit errors far more often than double ones.
//   - Two bits flip, parity passes, and the character the flipped bits name
//     prints instead. Near-misses rather than noise — the wrong letter is
//     always a letter or two away from the right one.
//   - A flip carries the code under 0x20, where the *control* codes live, and
//     a control code owns the rest of its row: 0x11-0x17 put the row into the
//     mosaic set, where the code that drew a letter draws a block. One hit,
//     and the back half of the line is graphics.
//   - The hit lands not on the text but on the *address* the packet carries,
//     and a whole row is delivered to the wrong line of the page: one line
//     printed twice, somewhere else left holding what it had. The address is
//     five bits, so a row never moves by an arbitrary distance — it moves by
//     one, two, four, eight or sixteen rows, and a packet addressed off the
//     end of the page is simply lost.
//
// The rate is the one number here that is taste rather than mechanism. A feed
// bad enough to show this on a fifteen-character card would be dropping whole
// rows; this is set to what makes a short card visibly unwell, and the split
// between holes and wrong characters is even rather than the ten-to-one a real
