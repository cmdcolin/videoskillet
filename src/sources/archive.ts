// Random video pulled live from archive.org, as a source either slot can show.
// The same shape as commons.ts — a channel is a *search*, and picking one rolls
// a clip out of it — for a pool Commons cannot supply: tape openings,
// distributor idents, and 80s/90s broadcast advertising. Commons is an
// encyclopedia's warehouse and holds almost none of that; archive.org holds tens
// of thousands of them, which is the whole reason this second source exists.
// `docs/adr` has nothing to say here, but two measured facts below decide the
// design, and both are easy to undo by accident.
//
// **Only `/cors/` is reachable from the browser.** `/download/` and `/serve/`
// answer with a 302 to `dn######.us.archive.org`, and that storage node sends no
// `access-control-*` header at all — so with the `crossOrigin = 'anonymous'`
// that videoSlot.ts sets on every element, the video does not merely taint the
// texture upload, it refuses to load (`MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED`).
// `/cors/<id>/<file>` answers 200 with the request Origin echoed back and no
// redirect off-host, which works from a hosted build with no dev proxy.
//
// **`/cors/` ignores `Range`.** It answers a range request with 200 and the
// whole file, and sends no `accept-ranges`. A `<video>` pointed straight at it
// plays, but `seekable` only ever covers what has downloaded — measured on a
// 628s clip: `seekable [[0, 4.3]]`, and assigning `currentTime = 502` read back
// as `4.3`. The seek is *silently clamped*: no error, no `seeking`, playback
// just carries on. That would break the cue in/out loop (gpu/videopump.ts) and
// the scrub bar (ui/useEngine.ts) in a way nothing on screen would explain. So a
// roll here downloads the whole file and hands the slot a `blob:` url, which is
// same-origin and therefore fully seekable — measured `seekable [[0, 628]]`, a
// seek landing in 50ms. That is what the byte caps below are really capping: the
// wait before the clip appears.
