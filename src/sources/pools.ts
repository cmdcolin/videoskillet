// The two pools as one front door.
//
// `pool.ts` holds what Commons and archive.org have in common as *types* and
// primitives; this holds it as *behaviour*. Everything above the sources — the
// engine, the picker, the shelf, the browser dialog — comes through here and
// never imports commons.ts or archive.ts directly, which is what collapsed the
// engine's two of everything into one: one roll, one resolve, one caption, one
// state slot per deck.
//
// The split is the import direction. commons.ts and archive.ts know nothing
// about each other and nothing about this file; this file knows both. Adding a
// third source is a module beside those two and four lines here.
