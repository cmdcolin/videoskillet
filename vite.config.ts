  // whole tree, so a run from the primary checkout collects every worktree's
  // suite as well as its own. Measured: 374 test files and 6746 tests against
  // this checkout's 68 and 1357.
  //
  // That is not merely slow. It means a half-finished branch someone else is
  // working on can fail *your* test run, in files you have never opened, and
  // the failure names a path that looks like yours because every worktree has

  // `dist` stay excluded — passing a bare array here silently drops both.
