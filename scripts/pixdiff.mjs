// Pixel A/B between two dev servers running different shader arms. The quality
// gate for any change that approximates something — fewer taps, a cheaper
// kernel, a lower-precision path — where "it looks the same to me" is not an
// answer. Reports mean and max channel error plus the tail of the distribution,
// because the failure mode of a thinned kernel is banding: a few units of error
// over a wide area, which a peak-error number alone will wave through.
//
//   node scripts/pixdiff.mjs <urlA> <urlB> [frames]
//
// Run each arm from its own `git worktree add --detach` copy with its own vite
// server (see CLAUDE.md) — that is what makes the two URLs differ by exactly one
// shader edit and nothing else.
//
// Establish the floor before trusting a result: point both URLs at the SAME
// server and confirm it prints max 0. It does, reproducibly, once the two traps
// below are handled — so a nonzero floor means the protocol has drifted, not
// that the noise is irreducible, and any A/B taken alongside it is worthless.
//
// Two traps, both of which produce a stable, convincing, wrong number:
//
// - Feedback state. With the loop live, each session accumulates a different
//   number of frames before loop.stop(), and any look with memory (phosphor,
//   phosphorBleed) never forgets the difference. `?set=phosphor:0,phosphorBleed:0`
//   isolates the pass under test; on `lightThatStays` (phosphor 0.999) the floor
//   is mean 0.7/255 with peaks of 212 and the A/B underneath it is unreadable.
// - Field parity. The engine is bistable on it, and which state a session lands
//   in depends on that same coin-flip frame count. It shows up as a floor that is
//   either exactly 0 or exactly mean ~0.6/255 with a max of 108 at one fixed
//   pixel — never anything between, which is the tell. Handled here by grabbing
//   two consecutive frames per arm and taking the better of the two alignments.
//
// Both of those are the same root cause, and it bounds what this script can
// compare at all: the two arms stop the loop at DIFFERENT absolute frame
// counts, so anything keyed to that counter cannot match and no alignment
// trick will save it. Establish the floor for the exact `?set=` you intend to
// A/B, not for a bare one — a control that looks innocent can put the floor at
// mean 30/255. Three families are out of reach:
//
//   - GPU noise seeded on P.frame: trackAmt, headClog, headSwitchNoise,
//     dropoutRate, tapeWear, tapeSplice, rfSnow, humAmp (its bar creeps per
//     frame), and anything that lands in rfNull/dropoutNull.
//   - CPU state advanced per frame or seeded per session: the impulse storm
//     clustering, the adjacent channel's wander, ingress keying, a paused
//     deck's servo (aPause/bPause), the time-base walk behind shuttleX.
//   - Loops above unity round-trip gain: cfbMix or tapeMix wound up is chaotic
//     by design, so it never forgets where it started. A SUB-unity loop does
//     converge to a session-independent fixed point and reads a clean 0 —
//     cfbMix 0.3 / cfbGain 0.5 / cfbFilterBoost 1 is a working resonant-loop
//     arm, and it is the strictest check there is on anything inside the loop,
//     because a one-bit error compounds every lap instead of averaging out.
//
// What IS comparable, and covers most of the signal path: accLagLines,
// colorUnderMix, combMode, chromaCoarse, svideoBleed, scramble, termination,
// vbi, mvAgcIre, mvStripe, dropoutComp, and the whole deflection/faceplate set
// (vSize, bendAmt, hvSag, crtSpot, crtConverge, crtSvm, crtPurity, maskAmt,
// crtZoom). Those hold a floor of 0 together.
