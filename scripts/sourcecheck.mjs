// Verification harness for the *interactive* source paths: the picker on each
// deck, and the teletype dialog.
//
// It exists because those are the paths nothing else here can reach. Every
// other harness drives the app through the query string, and a link goes in
// through `restoreSession` — a different door from the one a hand uses. The
// picker's own route (useEngine's `commitA`/`commitB`) had no coverage at all:
// nine load paths, no unit test that can touch them (the hook is a bag of
// browser objects), and a mistake in any of them shows up as a deck that lands
// on the right mode and the wrong picture.
//
// Which is the thing this actually checks. "The canvas is not black" is not
// worth running: peak channel saturates at ~242 on every source this app draws,
// so it would pass a deck still showing the *previous* picture under the new
// mode's name — exactly the failure a shared commit path can introduce. So each
// step takes a coarse per-tile signature, and the run fails on how far the
// picture moved from the step before it.
//
// The link it loads on is part of the instrument, not a convenience. At stock
// the composite is A plus a whisper of B (`bGain` 0.16), and measured that way
// the two decks cannot be told apart: a healthy B mode change moves the picture
// 0.9-1.8 by the metric below, and a *broken* A commit — one that lands the
// mode on the picker and leaves the old picture up — moves it 0.9-1.8 as well.
// No threshold separates those, and a gap the size of the noise is exactly
// where thresholds go wrong (the lesson ui/cue.ts records about wrap cost).
//
// So the confound is removed rather than thresholded. `?srcb=none` keeps B out
// of the composite while A is driven, so A alone is the picture; `?set=bGain:1`
// makes B the whole of it when B's turn comes.
//
// Measured that way against a deliberately broken build — `commitA` landing the
// mode without `showGenerated` — the two do not overlap at all:
//
//   broken   0.00 on every A row (the picture is literally the previous one)
//   healthy  2.58 at its tightest (sweep to tv static, two full-frame
//            patterns with similar tile means), 3.0-12.5 everywhere else
//
// Usage: node scripts/sourcecheck.mjs [baseUrl]
