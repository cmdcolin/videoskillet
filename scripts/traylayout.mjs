// Does anything in the strip move when the text in it changes?
//
// The tray's cards are shrink-to-fit — a card is as wide as its widest line —
// so every label inside one is load-bearing on layout. Step the hold chip from
// `hold` to `≈16 bars` and the card grows by a couple of dozen pixels, which
// pushes every card to its right along the row, under the pointer that is still
// sitting on the chip it just clicked. That is the whole class of bug this
// measures: a control that moves when you use it, and a neighbour that moves
// when you use something else.
//
//   node scripts/traylayout.mjs [port]
//
// Needs a dev server already running on that port (see docs/DEVELOPMENT.md —
// put it on a worktree copy, since an `src/` write mid-run is an HMR reload).
//
// **Nothing here waits on a frame.** Every reading is a synchronous layout
// after a click that React has already handled, so the occluded-window rAF trap
// that `until.mjs` describes does not apply — the sleeps are the "already
// happened by the time the next line runs" kind.
//
// The strip is seeded through `localStorage` rather than captured off the
// board, unlike `traycheck.mjs`. Capture is what that harness is for; here the
// rundown is a fixture, and one written directly is both faster and the same
// every run — which matters when what is being compared is pixel positions.
