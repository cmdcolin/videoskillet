// Which browser harnesses still work?
//
//   node scripts/sweep.mjs [port] [--only name,name] [--skip name,name]
//
// Needs a dev server on that port, on a worktree copy if anything else might be
// editing (docs/DEVELOPMENT.md). Runs each check against it in turn and prints
// one line per harness, then a roll-up.
//
// **Why this exists.** The unit suite runs on every push; not one browser
// harness does, because they need Firefox Nightly with WebGPU and CI has
// neither. So a harness can stop working and say nothing — and two of them had.
// `poolcheck`, the only coverage of the two live archives, was failing all
// twenty-six of its checks; `composecheck` was reading the chain map's zoom
// slider and reporting a CSS layer as broken that was not. Both were found by
// accident, months of commits after the panel change that broke them. A sweep
// is the cheapest thing that would have caught either.
//
// It reports each harness's own exit code and nothing cleverer. These scripts
// already print a line per check and exit non-zero on failure; the job here is
// only to run all of them and say which ones came back green, so a harness that
// has quietly died is a line in a list rather than a discovery.
//
// **Not everything in scripts/ belongs here**, and what is left out is as much
// the point as what is in:
//
//   - the device-torture harnesses (`deviceloss`, `devicetear`, `gpusleep`,
//     `rafceiling`, `soak`) deliberately break or exhaust a GPU device, which
//     is not something to do to a machine on the way past — and adr/0004 is
//     about what one of them costs a tab. Run those on purpose.
//   - the generators (`docshots`, `panelshots`, `gallery`, `logo`, `diagrams`,
//     `clips`, `labels`, `contact`) write files rather than judging anything.
//   - `compilercheck` and `guidecheck` need no server and already run in CI as
//     `pnpm compiler` and `pnpm guide:check`.
//   - `perf`, `loopseek`, `pullstep`, `codeccheck`, `pixdiff` and `affinity`
//     are measurements. They report numbers a human reads; there is no pass to
//     report. The two newest are why the frame-exact pull is built the way it
//     is — one closed the seek route and one opened the decoder route — and
//     both are worth re-running deliberately against a new browser build rather
//     than on the way past.
//
// **Two entries bring their own server**, which is a departure worth naming:
// `demuxcheck` and `pullcheck` build their own fixtures and serve them, because
// what they test is a file being read rather than the app being driven. They
// take the port and ignore it.
