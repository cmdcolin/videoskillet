// Visual regression for the control panel: eight states — six of the panel and
// two dialogs — screenshotted and diffed against committed baselines.
//
//   node scripts/panelshots.mjs            compare, exit 1 on drift
//   node scripts/panelshots.mjs --update   rewrite the baselines
//   node scripts/panelshots.mjs --only stage,input   just those states
//   node scripts/panelshots.mjs --url http://localhost:5173
//
// Why this exists. The panel is ~1000 CSS declarations across 27 modules, and
// the refactors it invites — hoist a rule, drop one the UA already draws, share
// a primitive — are all the kind that either change nothing or change one
// surface nobody had open. Nothing here could tell the difference. A textarea
// lost its border to exactly that class of edit and was caught only because
// somebody happened to look at it, which is not a test.
//
// The diff runs in the page rather than in Node: comparing two PNGs needs a
// decoder, and there is a whole browser already open with one. Both images go
// in as data URIs, onto canvases, and come back as a count of pixels that moved
// by more than a channel or two.
//
// Firefox Nightly, not Chrome — same reason as every other harness here (see
// CLAUDE.md). Deliberately not part of `pnpm test`: it wants a GPU and a
// display. And the baselines are this machine's font rendering, so a first run
// somewhere else will differ everywhere at once; that reads as "regenerate",
// not as a regression, and --update is how.
