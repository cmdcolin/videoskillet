// Fails if React Compiler cannot optimize a component or hook.
//
// Why this needs its own check: a bailout is not an error anywhere else. `pnpm
// build` succeeds, `tsc` succeeds, `oxlint` succeeds, the tests pass, and the
// page renders correctly — the compiler simply leaves that component
// unmemoized and says nothing. The only symptom is the panel getting slower,
// and in this app the panel is one component (`App`) that builds ~200 control
// rows, so a bailout there costs a re-render of all of them on every write.
//
// The known ways to trip it, both of which have happened here:
//
//   - reading a ref during render, including reading one *out of an object*,
//     which marks the whole object as ref-ish (see the `{ engine, engineRef }`
//     destructure in app.tsx);
//   - writing a ref during render, which is what the "latest callback" pattern
//     does if you reach for it.
//
// Run: `pnpm compiler`. Add `--verbose` to list what was optimized rather than
// only what was not.

// Bailouts that predate this check, recorded so the gate could go in without a
// refactor in front of it. Every line is something worth fixing rather than
// something that is fine — but none of them is on the panel's hot path (`App`,
// the control rows and the look bar all optimize), which is why they can wait.
//
// Two of them are ours and two are the compiler's:
//
//   - TeletypeDialog / useShortcuts read a ref during render, the exact fault
//     app.tsx's `{ engine, engineRef }` comment warns about;
//   - TeletypePaint writes locals after render, which is the paint surface
//     accumulating strokes outside React;
//   - Meter trips an internal invariant, and useVoteAuth uses `try/finally`,
//     which the compiler does not lower yet. Both are upstream, so re-check
//     them on a compiler upgrade rather than trying to satisfy them.
//
// Delete a line the moment its component compiles — the check says so when a
// recorded bailout stops happening.
