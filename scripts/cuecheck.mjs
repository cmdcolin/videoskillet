// Does a cued loop actually hold the playhead, in the real app?
//
// The clamp itself is unit-tested (gpu/videopump.test.ts) and so is the gesture
// (ui/cue.test.ts). What no test covers is the *wiring*, which crosses four
// layers and is where this feature can plausibly be broken while every unit test
// passes: a link's cue has to survive the async source load that clears it, a
// keypress has to reach the panel and be written through to the pump, and the
// pump has to be the one holding the playhead rather than the 10 Hz poll.
//
//   node scripts/cuecheck.mjs [port]
//
// Needs a dev server already running on that port (see docs/DEVELOPMENT.md — put
// it on a worktree copy if other agents are editing, since an src/ write mid-run
// is an HMR reload that resets the engine underneath the measurement).
//
// Four arms:
//
//   loop     ?cuea=1,1.4 on a link. Exercises the restore path: the cue is armed
//            before the source loads and claimed by `attach` afterwards, because
//            stopSlot deliberately clears it on the way through.
//   keys     `i` twice. Exercises tapCue -> writeCue -> setVideoRegion.
//   stab     `i` once, then `o`. A cue with no loop, and the retrigger jumping
//            back to it — the gesture that works with no loop involved at all.
//   control  no cue. Must roam the whole clip, or the other three prove nothing.
//
// Two readings per arm, and they check different things. `videoA.time` comes out
// of the ?debug frame log, which is the pump's own view of the element. The cue
// comes out of the address bar, which useUrlState mirrors the panel's state into
// — so the region each arm is judged against is the one the panel actually
// recorded, rather than one this file assumed. That is what makes the verdict
// unambiguous: `public/test.mp4` is 6s and loops on its own, so "the playhead
// went backwards" cannot tell a cued wrap from the clip ending.
