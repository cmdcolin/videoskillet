// Firefox Nightly, not Chrome: same reason as every other harness here (see
// CLAUDE.md). Serve it from a `git worktree add --detach` copy if anything else
// might be editing the tree — an HMR reload mid-run remounts the panel under the
// assertions and every later probe reads a different app.
//
// Wants the **dev server**: one check reads back which handler the app put on
// the engine, which only says anything unminified.
//
// Each check below is a regression that shipped:
//
//  - a query matching nothing drew the chain map anyway, over a stage list with
//    nothing in it, so the wires came out at x="NaN"
//  - …under a door offering to open "0 of them", directly above the panel's own
//    "nothing matches" line
//  - the filter box focused itself from an inline ref callback, so it stole
//    focus back on every re-render — four times a second, from the fps stat
//  - the fps stat was wired whether or not anything read it, which is what made
//    that four times a second
//  - `remove` in a row's modulation editor left the editor up claiming the bay
//    was full, having just freed a slot in it
//  - a routing could be removed but not held, so there was no way to hear the
//    picture without one wobble and then have it back
//  - the stabs row reads what the gate is running at, and the freeze pins that
//    at 0 — so with ❚❚ down the slider snapped back to 0 wherever it was
//    dragged, wrote nothing to the engine, and said nothing about why
//  - the popout window portaled into the app shell and so inherited its phone
//    rule, which stacks the halves into a column; in a column the cross axis is
//    width, where the panel's `margin-inline: auto` cancels the stretch it took
//    its width from, and a 340px popout laid the panel out 0px wide
