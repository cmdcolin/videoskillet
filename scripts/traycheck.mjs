// Does the strip tray actually drive the app, in the real app?
//
// The walk is unit-tested (ui/strip.test.ts), and so is the driver's own logic
// against a fake sink (ui/stripRun.test.ts). What no test covers is the
// *wiring*, which is where this can be broken with every unit test passing: a
// captured row has to be a query string the engine's own session apply accepts,
// a chip has to reach the runner and back out to the card, a drag has to
// reorder without also firing the row it grabbed, and the rundown has to
// survive as JSON.
//
//   node scripts/traycheck.mjs [port]
//
// Needs a dev server already running on that port (see docs/DEVELOPMENT.md —
// put it on a worktree copy if other agents are editing, since an src/ write
// mid-run is an HMR reload that resets the engine underneath the measurement).
//
// **The hold bar is checked by forcing a re-render, not by watching it.** Both
// the engine's frame counter and the strip's own tick are driven by rAF, and a
// browser throttles rAF for an occluded window — which is the trap
// docs/DEVELOPMENT.md already records for every harness here. Under puppeteer
// the window is nearly always occluded, so the bar sits still however long you
// wait, and that is the window manager rather than the app. Stepping the engine
// by hand advances the counter; a click then forces React to re-read the store,
// and the value it comes back with is what the bar *would* have been showing.
// Worth knowing about the feature and not only about the harness: when the tab
// stops getting frames the picture and the rundown freeze together, which is
// the right behaviour and a property of clocking the walk on frames rather than
// on the wall.
