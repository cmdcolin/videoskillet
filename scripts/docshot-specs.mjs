// - The enhancer's sync side (`enhSync`, `enhSliceIre` up in picture territory).
//   It hands the separator pulses minted from dark content, the AGC chases them,
//   and everything else here — two loops at just under unity — then compounds
//   whatever level is left. Even a touch of it takes the frame to black. The
//   resonant peak is what stays, which is the bend worth showing anyway.
