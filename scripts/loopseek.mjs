// What does it cost to loop a short section of a clip by seeking the <video>
// element back to an in-point?
//
// This is the one measurement that decides whether a tap-in/tap-out loop can be
// built on `currentTime = start` at all. A loop wrap is a seek, and a seek to a
// non-keyframe position is a decode from the previous keyframe forward — so the
// cost is not a property of the loop, it is a property of **how the clip was
// encoded**, which the app does not control and cannot see.
//
//   node scripts/loopseek.mjs [--laps=12] [--clip=all|single|gop3|intra] [--keep]
//   node scripts/loopseek.mjs --file=public/test.mp4        # a real file instead
//
// The three GOP structures are not hypothetical — they are what this repo
// already ships and loads:
//
//   single  one keyframe, at t=0 — `public/test.mp4`'s structure. Every wrap past
//           the start decodes from frame 0. (Use --file for the real thing: its
//           content is far more expensive to decode than this stand-in.)
//   gop3    a keyframe every ~3s, irregularly placed — example-popeye.mp4 (22.6s,
//           7 keyframes at 0, 5.0, 8.1, 10.0, 15.0, 17.9, 20.0). Not "the bundled
//           cartoons": they differ by more than an order of magnitude, and
//           haunted-house is at 5.3s spacing. Measure each one.
//   intra   every frame a keyframe. The best case, and the shape a clip would
//           have to be re-encoded into if seeking turns out to be the answer.
//
// The metric is the **wrap gap**: wall-clock ms between the last frame the
// compositor presented before the seek was issued and the first one it presented
// carrying a media time back inside the region. Compared against the same clip's
// unwrapped control run. A wrap gap near that baseline is a loop nobody can see
// the seam of; several times it is a hitch on every lap.
//
// **Read it off requestVideoFrameCallback, never off currentTime.** The first
// version of this harness measured the pump's own deliveries and reported every
// arm as free, including ones that visibly hitch. The reason is that currentTime
// reports the seek TARGET the instant a seek is issued: a frame decoded while the
// seek was still in flight got labelled with the time it was seeking to, so the
// stale picture counted as the wrap completing and a 250ms seek measured as 41ms.
// rVFC's mediaTime comes from the frame itself and cannot lie about this.
//
// Measured, Firefox Nightly 151 / Linux, `--laps=10`, stable across three runs
// (medians; the p95/worst columns pick up occasional multi-hundred-ms
// presentation stalls that the seeked column shows are not the seek's doing):
//
//   clip    in-point  frames back  wrap gap  seeked   verdict
//   single      1.0s           30      21ms    17ms   free — the one key is right there
//   single     16.4s          492     188ms   176ms   HITCH — 3.7x the 50ms baseline
//   gop3        1.0s           30      21ms    18ms   free
//   gop3       16.4s           42      42ms    23ms   free
//   intra       any             0      21ms     4ms   free, and faster than the cadence
//
// So: **seeking is a sound basis for a loop, and the cost is set by how many
// frames sit between the in-point and the previous keyframe.** Across those three
// synthetic arms it came to roughly a 17ms floor plus ~0.33ms a frame — 30 frames
// back is 21ms, 42 is 23ms, 492 is 176ms — and all-intra skips even the floor at
// 3-4ms, because there is nothing to decode forward from.
//
// **Do not carry that per-frame constant to real footage.** It is a property of
// the content, not of the browser, and `testsrc` is about as cheap a thing to
// decode as exists. Measured with `--file=` on what this repo actually ships, the
// same "frames back" buys an order of magnitude more:
//
//   file                    in-point   seeked, across runs
//   example-minnie-moocher   any         12-15ms
//   example-popeye           any         15-64ms
//   public/demo-v2.mp4       5.1s        62-90ms
//   public/test.mp4          0.9s        73-96ms
//   public/test.mp4          5.1s       122-165ms  (one run: 513ms)
//   example-haunted-house    3.18s      128-171ms
//   example-haunted-house   17.99s      194-233ms
//
// **Read the ordering, not the numbers.** Those are ranges because the absolute
// values move by about 2x with whatever else is running on the machine, and the
// outlier in brackets is real: one early run had test.mp4 at 513ms where every
// later run put it near 150ms. A single reading of this is worth very little, and
// a per-frame constant fitted to one is worth less — which is how the synthetic
// 0.33ms figure above came to be quoted as if it were general.
//
// What *is* stable across every run is the ranking, and it is the ranking the
// keyframe spacing predicts. So: denser keyframes are cheaper; measure the file you
// care about; and do not build a threshold on top of this without checking it on a
// quiet machine, because the gap between the fine tier (~90ms) and the slow tier
// (~150ms) is about the size of the run-to-run noise.
//
// Two consequences for anything built on this:
//
//   - **This is not a rare pathology.** Two of the four clips on this repo's own
//     shelf are in the slow tier: test.mp4 (one IDR in 180 frames) and
//     haunted-house (four keyframes in 21s), the latter anywhere in the file. The
//     cartoons are stream-copied excerpts and were never encoded for seeking.
//   - JS cannot see where the keyframes are, but it can time the wrap's own seek
//     with the `seeked` event, which tracks the visible gap within about 10%. The
//     app does exactly that and shows the number on the cue row — a number and not
//     a warning, for the calibration reason above (see ui/cue.ts).
//     `fastSeek()` is the other lever and is not a free win: it lands on a
//     keyframe, which on a 5s-GOP clip can be seconds outside a short loop.
//
// Firefox Nightly, per CLAUDE.md — Chrome's Linux backend is not the target and
// its seek path is not the one users will be on.
//
// One aside worth keeping: `await v.play()` after setting currentTime on a
// freshly-loaded element can hang without ever settling, which is why the run
// below fires play() unawaited behind a timer watchdog. videoSlot.ts's `roll()`
// chains `slot.attach` off that same promise, so a slot that never rolls is a
// shape that can happen — unrelated to looping, but it is the same promise.
