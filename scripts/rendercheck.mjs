// Does a take render the same twice, and is the file what it says it is?
//
//   node scripts/rendercheck.mjs [port]
//
// The render owns its own time, its own dice and its own starting state, so two
// renders of one take are **the same file, byte for byte** — asserted below on
// a SHA-256 of each — while one of them has real time injected between its
// yields and the live loop runs between the two.
//
// That assertion is younger than the harness. The version before `startTake`
// could only claim that a take was the same take *from the same starting
// state*, and measured the gap: frame N was a function of N and of the tape
// ring, the phosphor persistence and the PLL's lock age at frame zero, so the
// second render began with a different history and the two files came out about
// 3% apart in size. `startTake` is what closed it — every buffer back to what
// the device handed over, every CPU modulator rebuilt, and the dice seeded — so
// the thing this file used to explain it could not check is now the headline
// check (docs/EDITOR.md › _Take state_).
//
// **The clip exclusion is gone**, and it was the older of two. This file used
// to say a take over a `<video>` could not be reproducible because the pump
// pulled at wall rate, and so rendered the default bars. Frame-exact pull is
// what removed it: the last arm below loads `public/test.mp4` through the app's
// own `?vurl` path and renders it twice, and the two files match byte for byte.
//
// That arm asks the pump whether the deck actually had a decoder on it, which
// is not paranoia: two renders of a *frozen* deck are also identical, so
// "identical" on its own cannot tell a working pull from a fallback that never
// moved. It is also last on purpose — everything before it renders bars, so a
// failure there is the render and a failure only there is the video path.
//
// One exclusion stands: a take is reproducible *within a browser build*. The
// H.264 encoder is Firefox's, and nothing here asserts across versions of it.
//
// It grew arms as the halves of a take arrived, and they follow the same shape
// as the headline: render it twice for the same file, and render it *without*
// for the control that says the thing under test is what made the file what it
// is. The rundown's walk is one (_One walk, two clocks_); the automation tape
// is another (_Live input has no offline meaning_), plus one arm on the
// recorder itself, which is the only piece here that has to work against a
// frame counter the window manager is moving.
