//
// --vp=WxH sets the viewport BEFORE navigation — the one safe moment; after
// load it swaps the BiDi realm and window.vf vanishes (see below). The canvas
// the run actually measured is reported, since layout and dpr decide it.
//
// --ablate attributes cost per pass: it disables one pass at a time by
// overriding its `when` gate, interleaving full and ablated batches in one
// session, and reports each pass's delta. The deltas are not perfectly
// additive (passes overlap on the GPU) but they rank the hot spots honestly.
//
// USE --ablate TO RANK, NOT TO SIZE. Its deltas are the least trustworthy
// number this script prints, and they read like the most precise. crt_face's
// scatter gather was recorded from one at 0.9 ms and is 0.30; the same pass has
// come back anywhere from 0.16 to 1.01 ms across identical runs on a quiet box.
// Two separate reasons, and neither announces itself:
//
//  - Another GPU client shifts whole batches ~0.8 ms while leaving the best
//    alone. A second stepped session costs +3.6 ms here, an idle app tab left
//    presenting +0.17 ms. Both modes now flag this as DISTURBED. Clean sessions
//    spread under 2% across batches, hence the 5% threshold — but it only
//    catches a neighbour that ARRIVES mid-run. One running steadily through the
//    whole session inflates every batch together, the spread stays tight, and
//    nothing here will tell you. Check what else holds a WebGPU tab open first.
//  - The baseline drifts within a session, and a delta is a subtraction against
//    it. Paired per-round subtraction (below) removes that term; what is left
//    still ranges 0.38-0.55 ms on a small pass, so a SHAKY row is marked.
//
// To size a change, build both versions and A/B whole frames, best-of,
// interleaved, one dev server per arm off its own worktree. That method held to
// 0.001 ms over three rounds on a change the ablate delta could not resolve at
// all. `scripts/pixdiff.mjs` is its other half, for what the change costs the
// picture.
//
// Traps, learned the hard way:
// - Never call page.setViewport AFTER navigation under Firefox BiDi — it
//   swaps the realm and every later evaluate sees window.vf undefined.
//   Before goto (as scripts/shot.mjs does) it is safe.
// - One browser per config; a page driven through many WebGPU sessions
//   detaches its frame partway through a run.
// - Serve from a `git worktree add --detach` copy when anyone (or any agent)
//   might touch the tree: an HMR reload mid-run tears the engine down and the
//   remaining batches measure a dead page.
// - For A/B, alternate base and patched runs back to back; session-to-session
//   GPU clock drift is several percent.
