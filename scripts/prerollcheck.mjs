// Does loading the next clip during this one make the cut cheaper?

//   node scripts/prerollcheck.mjs [port]
//
// Preroll depth 1 (docs/EDITOR.md › _Performance: the boundary is the only
// cost_). Steady-state playback does not care how long a rundown is — the pump
// yields one decode per newly decoded source frame whatever is attached — so
// all of the cost is at the cut: a new element, the network, the first frame.
// A second element already loaded and parked at its in-point is that cost paid
// during the bar before it.
//
// So the measurement is the cut, and it is taken twice over the same clip on
// the same deck: once cold, once with the clip prerolled. What is timed is
// `playUrl` to the element being ready to show a frame — `readyState >= 2`,
// which is HAVE_CURRENT_DATA, the first moment there is a picture to attach.
//
// **The cold arm has to be genuinely cold**, and that is most of what this file
// is careful about: a browser that has already fetched a url serves the second
// load out of its HTTP cache, which would make both arms fast and the check
// meaningless. Each arm therefore uses its own url with a cache-busting query,
// so the two are the same bytes and different cache entries.

// it at all: **is the url stable?**

// `URL.createObjectURL` mints a fresh string per call, so the File a preroll
// opens and the File a cut opens are two urls for one file, and `playUrl`'s
// identity match — which every other source satisfies for free — can never fire.
// Every cut between two shelf clips therefore loaded from scratch beside an
// element already holding the picture: preroll paying its whole cost and buying
// nothing. `Preroll.clip` is the identity that survives that, and `prerolledClip`
// is how a cut asks which url to open under.
//
// A Blob rather than a picked File, deliberately: what is under test is the
// url minting and the promotion, and a real disk handle would drag the shelf's
// IndexedDB and a permission prompt into a harness that is timing a cut.
