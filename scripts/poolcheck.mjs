// Verification harness for the two public archives: does a random pick roll a
// file, does the ★ put it on the clip shelf, does the shelf play it back, does
// the browser dialog come back with thumbnails from both, and is a roll that
// lands late dropped rather than pushed onto a slot the user has moved on from.
//
// Usage: node scripts/poolcheck.mjs [http://localhost:5199]
//
// Unlike every other harness here this one talks to third parties. That is the
// point of it: `src/sources/commons.test.ts` and `archive.test.ts` hold the
// readers against response shapes that were real *once*, and nothing in the test
// suite would notice commons.wikimedia.org changing its mind about
// `descriptionurl`, dropping `gsrsort=random`, or rendering its transcode ladder
// differently — nor archive.org retiring `services/img/`, which is the endpoint
// the whole browser dialog leans on to show a clip without downloading it.
// A handful of live requests per run, well inside anonymous API etiquette.
//
// It exits non-zero with a line per failed check, so it can be run as a gate. A
// network failure reads as a failure — there is no useful "skipped" here, since
// the whole subject is the network.
