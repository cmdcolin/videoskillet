// What does a loop's wrap cost the *sound*?
//
//   node scripts/wrapsound.mjs [port] [--clip=all|intra|dense|sparse] [--keep]
//
// Needs a dev server already running on that port (docs/DEVELOPMENT.md — put it
// on a worktree copy if other agents are editing, since an src/ write mid-run is
// an HMR reload that resets the engine underneath the measurement). Needs ffmpeg
// and ffprobe, the way scripts/loopseek.mjs does, and for the same reason: the
// clip has to be encoded on purpose.
//
// **Why this exists.** `docs/IDEAS.md` › _Clip cues_ says the loop's wrap drops
// the clip's audio for a fifth to half a second, and gets there by inference:
// `loopHealth().medianMs` is 199-524ms between issuing the wrap's seek and its
// `seeked`, and an element that is seeking is not playing. That is sound
// reasoning about a seek and still not the same thing as having listened. It
// says so itself — "measure before building" — because the fix (a second read
// head, docs/EDITOR.md › _Performance_) costs a policy decision about the one
// preroll slot per deck, and that is not a price worth paying for an inference.
//
// So this listens, on the app's own audio path.
//
// **The instrument is an AudioWorklet tapping the app's analyser**, not the
// analyser's own reading, and the difference is what makes the run trustworthy
// here. `AudioState.level` is recomputed once per *rendered* frame, so reading
// it means measuring sound through the rendering step — and an occluded window
// throttles rAF to about 1 Hz (docs/DEVELOPMENT.md), which would have reported a
// covered window as a permanent dropout. A worklet runs on the audio thread at
// 128-sample quanta whatever the compositor is doing: 2.67ms granularity, and
// nothing about it depends on the window being in front.
//
// It taps `graph.analyser` because that is where everything routed arrives —
// same node the app reads, so this is the app's sound and not a second copy of
// it — through a zero gain to the destination, so the tap adds nothing audible.
//
// Two more things about the method, stated rather than left to be inferred:
//
//   - **The source is a continuous 440Hz tone**, generated with the picture. On
//     music a quiet bar and a dropout are the same reading; on a tone, floor
//     means silence and nothing else. That is why the arms are encoded here
//     rather than pointed at `public/` — and `public/test.mp4`, the sparse clip
//     the existing readings come from, has no audio track at all.
//   - **The control arm is the same clip with no loop marked.** Without it, "the
//     sound sits at floor" cannot be told from an analyser that was never fed,
//     an autoplay block, or a tone that is not there.
//
// The GOP arms are loopseek's, because the question underneath is the same one:
// a seek's cost is set by how far back the previous keyframe is, so if the
// silence *is* the seek then silence must order the same way. `intra` is the
// control from the other end — a wrap that costs nothing to decode should cost
// nothing to hear.
//
// **The engine is stepped from Node rather than left on rAF**, for the reason
// above: the region clamp lives in `VideoPump.pump()`, which runs once per
// rendered frame, so a throttled window would wrap the loop once a second and
// this would be measuring the window manager. Pausing the loop and stepping it
// from the poll below makes the frame rate a known quantity — `render.ts` makes
// the same move for the same reason.
