// Does a transition break the picture, cut in the middle, and give the board
// back?
//
//   node scripts/faultcheck.mjs [port]
//
// The shelf is a table of recipes over controls that already exist
// (docs/EDITOR.md › _Transitions_), so what needs checking is not the values —
// `ui/transitions.test.ts` holds those against the slider ranges — but the three
// claims the engine makes about running one:
//
//   1. it moves the picture, which is the only observable the fault has;
//   2. it never touches the resting board, so the panel never sees it and a
//      preset saved mid-transition is the look rather than the fault;
//   3. it lands the cut on the frame the picture is least legible, which is the
//      whole reason the cut is a callback and not something React polls for;
//   4. and it **resolves** — which is the word in the name, and the one thing
//      here that is a measurement rather than an assertion about a number.
//
// **The picture does not come back on the frame the board does**, and that is
// the mechanism rather than a defect in it. The first version of the fourth
// check asserted a hash match one frame after the span ended and failed on every
// entry by the same amount: the board is handed back inside the frame, but the
// phosphor is still holding the tracking band, the loop bin has recorded the
// broken frames, and the PLL is still walking its lock back. So what is measured
// is the shape — far from rest at the cut, near it again after the memory has
// had a moment — which is what "a fault that resolves" actually claims.
//
// And measured against a control rather than against zero, for a reason worth
// knowing before trusting any number this file prints: see the floor arm below.
//
// Driven frame by frame off `step()` under a take, so the fault's own clock is
// the only thing moving and every reading below is exact rather than sampled
// out of a running loop. Sampled through a 64x48 downscale rather than
// `getImageData` on the real canvas: a 1352x900 read per frame is 4.8MB, five
// hundred times over, and it was most of the run.
//
// **Give it the front window.** This is one of the harnesses docs/DEVELOPMENT.md
// means when it says a check that samples the canvas as it paints has to own the
// screen — behind another window nothing consumes the swapchain, `step()` itself
// backs up, and a run that takes two minutes in front takes past the protocol
// timeout behind. It is a slow run rather than a wrong one, and it reports as a
// `ProtocolError` naming no cause, which is why everything below is as few
// stepped frames as the claims allow.
