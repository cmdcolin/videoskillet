//
// Five places in the signal path measure a *rate* rather than taking a
// per-frame step — the two glide reads, the stab gate, the strobe gate and the
// PLL's auto-lock — and off the wall clock they land on different frames
// depending on how fast the machine was that day. `startTake` points all five
// at the frame counter instead. This measures that it took.
//
// The clock is one of three things `startTake` holds still (the dice and the
// signal state are the other two, and `scripts/rendercheck.mjs` is where the
// whole switch is measured against a file). Here it is the clock alone that is
// under test, which is why every arm below starts its glide *after* the switch:
// a morph in flight when a take begins is stopped by it, deliberately, since
// its origin was stamped on a clock that no longer exists.
//
// **What it deliberately does not claim.** A first version hashed the canvas
// after two runs and asserted the pixels matched. That test cannot pass while
// the app's own rAF loop is running: the loop advances the frame counter during
// any real time between steps, so two runs step different totals and what is
// being measured is the window manager. Determinism needs the virtual clock
// *and* ownership of the loop, and only the first of those exists — which is
// exactly the gap docs/EDITOR.md now records against build-order step 1.
//
// So what is measured is the inversion itself, in a synchronous burst where rAF
// cannot interleave: sixty stepped frames of no real time finish a one-second
// morph on the virtual clock and barely start it on the wall clock. The
// wall-clock arm is a control rather than a formality — if it finished too,
// the other arm would be measuring nothing.
