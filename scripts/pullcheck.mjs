// Does `ui/framePull.ts` hand back the frame that is actually there, and what
// does it cost?
//
//   node scripts/pullcheck.mjs [--frames=120] [--fps=60]
//
// Three harnesses lead here and this is the one that closes the loop.
// `pullstep.mjs` measured the seek route and closed it; `codeccheck.mjs`
// measured the decoder in isolation; `demuxcheck.mjs` proved the sample table
// against ffprobe. What none of them can say is whether the thing built out of
// those parts returns **frame N of the clip when asked for time N/fps**, which
// is the entire claim, and the one failure mode that reads as success in every
// timing column: a puller that returns some frame, promptly, forever.
//
// So the fixture has the frame number burnt into the picture, and this reads it
// back off the decoded frame. Not a digest, not "did it change" — the number.
// A frame that is one off, or that repeats where the clip moved, fails here and
// nowhere else.
//
// Four arms, and the last two are what a rundown does rather than what a demo
// does:
//
//   walk     0, 1, 2 … at the take's rate. The ordinary case, and the one the
//            cost is quoted from.
//   repeat   a 60fps take over a 30fps clip, where every source frame is wanted
//            twice. It is the common case, and it is the one a cache that
//            evicts too eagerly turns into a decoder reset per frame.
//   jump     the in-points a rundown's cuts land on, in the order a rundown
//            would. Backwards is a reset by construction, so this is where the
//            fallback cost lives and it should be paid once per jump.
//   tail     the last frames of the clip, where the reorder tail has to be
//            flushed out rather than pushed out by the samples after it —
//            which is the one path with no more input behind it.
//
// **Measured, Firefox Nightly 151 / Linux, 120 frames an arm.** Every arm
// returns the frame it was asked for, on all three fixtures, including the one
// where two thirds of the frames are B-frames.
//
//   clip      walk      jump      tail
//   single    3.54ms   40.59ms   31.73ms
//   gop3      0.85ms   10.33ms    3.94ms
//   bframes   0.82ms    2.64ms    1.32ms   (means)
//
// Two things to read off that, and neither is the mean on its own.
//
//   - **The walk is the number the render pays**, and at 0.85ms it is
//     `codeccheck.mjs`'s 0.53ms decode plus the bookkeeping around it. Against
//     `pullstep.mjs`'s seek route on the same fixtures — 38ms on gop3, 183ms on
//     single — that is 45x on the good clip and 50x on the bad one, and the
//     spread between the two clips has collapsed from 5x to 4x-of-almost-
//     nothing. Which is the point: nothing seeks, so keyframe spacing stops
//     deciding.
//   - **The jump arm's mean is not its cost.** Its p95 is 3ms and its median is
//     0, so the mean is four resets in 120 pulls — a backward cut on a clip
//     with one keyframe decodes from the top, and that is the price of a cut
//     rather than of a frame. A rundown pays it once per row, where the seek
//     route paid its own version once per *frame*.
